## Detailed Interpretation Guide

### Understanding NDVI (Vegetation Index)

**What is NDVI?**
- Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
- Measures vegetation health and density
- Range: 0-255 (higher = healthier vegetation)

**Interpretation Values:**
- **"Vegetation growth or improvement"**: NDVI increased significantly
- **"Vegetation loss or degradation"**: NDVI decreased significantly
- **"No significant vegetation change"**: NDVI change below threshold

**Example Analysis:**
```
Property 1: NDVI Before=102.5, After=118.25, Difference=+15.75
Interpretation: "Vegetation growth or improvement"
Significance: Yes (change > threshold)
```

### Understanding NDBI (Built-up Index)

**What is NDBI?**
- Normalized Difference Built-up Index
- Detects built-up areas and construction
- Range: 0-255 (higher = more built-up areas)

**Interpretation Values:**
- **"Construction or development increase"**: NDBI increased significantly
- **"Demolition or clearing"**: NDBI decreased significantly
- **"No significant built-up area change"**: NDBI change below threshold

**Example Analysis:**
```
Property 2: NDBI Before=0.0, After=27.5, Difference=+27.5
Interpretation: "Construction or development increase"
Significance: Yes (change > threshold)
```

### Understanding NDWI (Water Index)

**What is NDWI?**
- Normalized Difference Water Index
- Detects water bodies and moisture
- Range: 0-255 (higher = more water/moisture)

**Interpretation Values:**
- **"Water increase or flooding"**: NDWI increased significantly
- **"Water decrease or drying"**: NDWI decreased significantly
- **"No significant water change"**: NDWI change below threshold

**Example Analysis:**
```
Property 3: NDWI Before=0.0, After=0.0, Difference=0.0
Interpretation: "No significant water change"
Significance: No (change below threshold)
```

```

## Statistical Significance

### Threshold System
- **Default Threshold**: 0.1 (10% change)
- **Significance**: Changes above threshold are marked "Yes"
- **Non-significance**: Changes below threshold are marked "No"

### Why Significance Matters
- **Significant Changes**: Require attention and monitoring
- **Non-significant Changes**: Normal variations or measurement noise
- **Multiple Significant Changes**: Indicate major land use transformation

## Common Scenarios and Interpretations

### 1. Agricultural Development
```
Vegetation: Significant increase (new crops)
Built-up: Moderate increase (farm infrastructure)
Water: No change or moderate increase (irrigation)
```

### 2. Urban Development
```
Vegetation: Significant decrease (clearing)
Built-up: Significant increase (construction)
Water: Decrease (drainage changes)
```

### 3. Natural Disaster Recovery
```
Vegetation: Decrease then recovery
Built-up: Decrease (damage)
Water: Increase (flooding) then decrease
```

### 4. Seasonal Changes
```
Vegetation: Moderate seasonal variations
Built-up: No change
Water: Seasonal variations
```
