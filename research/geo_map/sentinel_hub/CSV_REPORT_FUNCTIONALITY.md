# CSV Report Functionality

## Overview

The Sentinel Hub Land Monitoring system now generates **formal CSV reports** in addition to the JSON output. The JSON remains the master format for detailed data, while the CSV provides a structured, formal report suitable for business presentations, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder communication.
