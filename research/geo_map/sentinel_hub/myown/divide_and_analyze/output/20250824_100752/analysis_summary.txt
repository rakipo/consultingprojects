INFERENCE INFORMATION
----------------------------------------
NDVI Inferences:
- >0.6: High vegetation density - Dense forest/agriculture
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate vegetation - Mixed vegetation/grassland
- 0.2-0.4: Low vegetation - Sparse vegetation/grass
- 0-0.2: Very low vegetation - Barren land with some vegetation
- <0: No vegetation - Urban/built-up/water bodies

NDBI Inferences:
- >0.2: High built-up area - Dense urban development
- 0.1-0.2: Moderate built-up - Suburban/residential areas
- 0-0.1: Low built-up - Rural settlements/roads
- -0.1-0: Very low built-up - Natural areas with minimal development
- <-0.1: No built-up - Natural vegetation/water bodies

NDWI Inferences:
- >0.3: High water content - Water bodies/wetlands
- 0.1-0.3: Moderate water - Moist soil/irrigated areas
- 0-0.1: Low water - Slightly moist areas
- -0.2-0: Very low water - Dry areas
- <-0.2: No water - Very dry/urban areas

COORDINATE INFORMATION
----------------------------------------
Each square includes:
- Center coordinates (lat, lon)
- Four corner coordinates as (lat, lon) pairs:
  * NW: Northwest corner
  * NE: Northeast corner
  * SE: Southeast corner
  * SW: Southwest corner
Coordinates are in decimal degrees (WGS84)

KML COLOR CODING (BORDERS ONLY)
----------------------------------------
ðŸ”µ Blue borders: High-quality vegetation significance
ðŸ”´ Red borders: High-quality built-up area significance
ðŸŸ¡ Yellow borders: High-quality water/moisture significance
Lighter colored borders: Medium-quality detections
Note: Squares are shown as borders only (no fill)
