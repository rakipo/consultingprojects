# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a Python-based Telugu document OCR system that can extract text from scanned PDF documents containing printed tables and handwritten Telugu script. The system should evaluate multiple OCR tools and APIs, prioritizing free solutions while identifying paid alternatives that offer better accuracy. The initial version will focus on full automation without user intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extract Telugu text from scanned PDF documents, so that I can digitize Telugu language documents containing both printed and handwritten content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF file containing Telugu documents is provided THEN the system SHALL extract text from both printed tables and handwritten Telugu script
2. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL output the extracted text in CSV or Excel format per page
3. WHEN multiple pages exist in the PDF THEN the system SHALL process all pages sequentially and create separate output files per page
4. IF the document contains tables THEN the system SHALL preserve table structure in the CSV/Excel output
5. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL also create a consolidated text file showing all extracted content per page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to evaluate all available OCR tools and APIs in the market, so that I can identify the most effective solution for Telugu text extraction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating OCR solutions THEN the system SHALL test all major available OCR tools/APIs in the market
2. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive comparison report of accuracy and performance
3. IF free solutions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL identify and document paid alternatives with better accuracy rates
4. WHEN documenting solutions THEN the system SHALL include API integration steps for each evaluated tool
5. WHEN evaluation is complete THEN the system SHALL cover both cloud-based and offline OCR solutions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a fully automated Python program, so that I can process Telugu documents without manual intervention in the initial version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the program is executed THEN it SHALL process the input PDF automatically without user interaction
2. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL handle file input/output operations independently
3. IF errors occur during processing THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing remaining content
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL save results to an output file automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Python-only solution without API or UI components, so that I can focus on core OCR functionality in the initial implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the solution THEN it SHALL be a standalone Python program
2. WHEN running the program THEN it SHALL not require web API endpoints or user interface components
3. WHEN dependencies are needed THEN they SHALL be Python libraries that can be installed via pip
4. IF external APIs are used THEN they SHALL be called as clients from the Python program, not hosted as services

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized output with proper file structure, so that I can easily access and review extraction results from different methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL save all output files to "output/<timestamp>/<method_used>/" directory structure
2. WHEN creating output THEN the system SHALL generate timestamped folders for each processing session
3. WHEN using different OCR methods THEN the system SHALL create separate subdirectories for each method tested
4. WHEN saving files THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent naming conventions across all output formats

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want quality assessment and improvement recommendations, so that I can understand extraction accuracy and next steps for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically assess the clarity and accuracy of the output
2. WHEN quality is below acceptable standards THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for improvement
3. WHEN suggesting next steps THEN the system SHALL include alternative methods, preprocessing techniques, or manual intervention options
4. WHEN generating quality reports THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores and error analysis where available

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed documentation of OCR tool evaluation, so that I can make informed decisions about which tools to use and how to integrate them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating each OCR tool THEN the system SHALL document accuracy rates for Telugu text extraction
2. WHEN testing APIs THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step integration instructions
3. WHEN comparing solutions THEN the system SHALL include cost analysis for both free and paid options
4. IF API keys or authentication are required THEN the system SHALL document the setup process clearly
