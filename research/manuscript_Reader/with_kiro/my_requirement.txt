test_manu.pdf has the images/scanned copy of the telugu language documents. these are having printed tables and manual telugu script with the entries. 
I know there is no method which is perfect to extract the manuscript that too in the telugu. 
try all the available tools and let me know the details of any API creation steps. 
preference is free version first. if any paid one which can give better rate, I am fine. 

initial version I would like to achive with total automation . then will involve man in the middle.

write the specs for above python based application. 
only require python program NO API or UI required for now.
