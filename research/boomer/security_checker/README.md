# Security Checker for Prompt-Driven Development

A comprehensive security analysis tool designed specifically for prompt-driven development workflows. This tool helps identify security vulnerabilities, enforce best practices, and ensure safe development practices when working with AI-generated code.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Analyze current directory with main.py
python security_analyzer.py . main.py

# Analyze specific project
python security_analyzer.py /path/to/project app.py

# Run comprehensive security check
./run_security_check.sh /path/to/project main.py
```

### Docker Usage (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and run in isolated container
docker-compose up --build

# Run one-time analysis
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app security-analyzer
```

## üìã Features

### üîç Security Analysis
- **SQL Injection Detection** - Identifies vulnerable database queries
- **Secret Detection** - Finds hardcoded passwords, API keys, tokens
- **Dangerous Operations** - Detects risky system calls and eval usage
- **File Operations** - Monitors file system access patterns
- **Network Access** - Tracks external network connections

### üìä Comprehensive Reporting
- **Risk Scoring** - Quantitative security risk assessment
- **Severity Classification** - CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- **Detailed Recommendations** - Specific remediation guidance
- **Multiple Formats** - JSON and human-readable reports

### üê≥ Docker Integration
- **Isolated Development** - Secure containerized environment
- **Production-Ready** - Security-hardened container configuration
- **Easy Deployment** - Docker Compose setup included

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checks

### Critical Issues
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Use of `eval()`, `exec()`, `compile()`
- Unsafe system command execution
- Hardcoded secrets in code

### High Priority Issues
- Potential secret leakage
- Unsafe file operations
- Missing input validation
- Insecure network communications

### Medium Priority Issues
- File system operations without validation
- Missing error handling
- Insufficient logging
- Configuration issues

### Low Priority Issues
- Network access patterns
- Code quality concerns
- Documentation gaps
- Performance implications

## üîß Installation

### Local Installation
```bash
# Clone or copy the security_checker directory
cd security_checker

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x run_security_check.sh
```

### Docker Installation
```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t security-analyzer .

# Or use docker-compose
docker-compose build
```

## üìñ Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Security Analysis
```bash
python security_analyzer.py ../my_project main.py
```

### 2. Comprehensive Security Check
```bash
./run_security_check.sh ../my_project main.py
```

### 3. Docker Analysis
```bash
# Analyze project in secure container
docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/project:/app:ro \
  -v /path/to/reports:/app/security_reports:rw \
  security-analyzer
```

### 4. CI/CD Integration
```bash
# In your CI/CD pipeline
./run_security_check.sh . main.py
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Security issues found - blocking deployment"
  exit 1
fi
```

## üìä Report Interpretation

### Risk Scores
- **0-9**: LOW - Monitor and improve over time
- **10-19**: MEDIUM - Review and fix when possible
- **20-49**: HIGH - Address before deployment
- **50+**: CRITICAL - Immediate action required

### Severity Levels
- **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities that could lead to system compromise
- **HIGH**: Significant security risks that should be addressed promptly
- **MEDIUM**: Security concerns that should be reviewed and fixed
- **LOW**: Best practice violations and minor security considerations

## üß™ Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
python -m pytest test_security.py -v
```

### Test with Sample Vulnerable Code
```bash
# Create test file with known vulnerabilities
echo 'cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")' > test_vuln.py

# Run analysis
python security_analyzer.py . test_vuln.py

# Should detect SQL injection
```

## üê≥ Docker Security Features
