Part 1: Build a Full Persona / Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

You need both the who and the why they care.

Ask the following questions:

    Persona Identity

        - What is their name? (realistic, e.g. "Susan, 52, Sandwich Generation")
        - What is their age, life stage, or family status?
        - What job or role do they hold?
        - Where do they live or spend time online?
        - What do they value (e.g., stability, independence, trust)?
        - How tech-savvy are they?
        - What media do they consume?

    Pain & Frustration

        - What are their top 3 pain points right now?
        - What are they struggling to understand or decide?
        - What emotions are tied to these pains? (guilt, overwhelm, urgency, fear)
        - What keeps them up at night?
        - What would failure look like to them?

    Goals & Motivations

        - What do they want more than anything?
        - What are their short-term and long-term goals?
        - What would success look like for them?
        - What would make them feel proud or relieved?

    Barriers & Objections

        - What's holding them back from taking action?
        - What have they tried that didn't work?
        - What do they believe about AI / care / tech / your space?
        - What fears do they have about change?

    Buyer Behavior

        - What triggers them to start looking for a solution?
        - How do they research and make decisions?
        - Who influences their decisions (spouse, advisor, employer)?
        - What would make them trust someone with this?

Part 2: Generate Pillar Blog Topics + Subtopics (tied to Persona & Goals)

Once you have a persona, the blog strategy is simple:

    Pillar Topics = Their core problems
    Subpillars = Their questions, blockers, and desires

Use these GraphRAG queries or Claude prompts to extract them.

    Pillar Topic Prompts

        - What are the 5 most urgent problems [persona] is facing?
        - What topics have the most pain points mapped in the graph?
        - What core life decisions is [persona] struggling with?
        - What themes appear most in past questions from this persona?
        - What services or offers target this persona's core pain?

    These become your main content buckets.

    Example (for Susan):

        - Housing for aging parents
        - Long-term care planning
        - Legal/financial stress
        - Sandwich generation burnout
        - Navigating family conflict

    Subpillar / Support Topic Prompts

        - What questions does [persona] ask about [pillar topic]?
        - What objections or beliefs stop them from acting?
        - What fears or myths surround this topic?
        - What do they search for on YouTube/Google?
        - What parts of this topic are confusing or emotional?
        - What solutions have they tried and failed?

    These become your individual blog posts, lead magnets, videos.

    Example:

        Pillar: Housing for aging parents

            - Sub: "How to talk to your parents about moving"
            - Sub: "Assisted living vs memory care: what's the difference?"
            - Sub: "Can Medicare help pay for housing?"
            - Sub: "What to do if your parent refuses to move"
