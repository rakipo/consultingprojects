Summary
We've built a unified PostgreSQL database containing structured content scraped from multiple domains (in progress are healthcare, legal, senior living, etc.). Now, we're transitioning from flat storage to a graph intelligence layer using Neo4j.

Neo4j will serve as the knowledge graph and reasoning engine, enabling advanced use cases like trend detection, topical clustering, smart retrieval (GraphRAG), and decision support agents.

To do this right, we're adopting Neo4j's official MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration layer, which supports intelligent schema design and LLM-driven ingestion using Claude/GPT agents.

=================
What You'll Work With

You will not write a scraper. That's already done. You will:

1. Pull cleaned content from PostgreSQL (structured_content table).
2. Transform that into graph-compatible entities/relationships using Claude/GPT or manually for now.
3. Push into Neo4j using Cypher, aligned with a well-defined graph schema.
4. Set up the MCP Cypher Server so Claude/GPT agents can query, write, and model in Neo4j.
5. Optionally explore the Data Modeling MCP Server to define and evolve the schema with Claude.

What MCP Is

https://neo4j.com/developer/genai-ecosystem/model-context-protocol-mcp/

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an emerging standard that allows LLMs (like Claude or GPT) to interact with databases and tools via structured commands (like get_schema, write_cypher, etc.).

Neo4j has officially adopted this. They provide two MCP server implementations:

Server Type | Role
Cypher MCP Server | Accepts read/write Cypher queries from LLM agents
Data Modeling MCP | Lets agents model schemas, validate relationships, etc.

This means you can:
- Let LLMs design or evolve the graph schema via natural language.
- Auto-generate ingestion scripts.
- Push new nodes/relationships programmatically via LLM-backed interfaces.

We'll likely run both servers locally or via Docker to support agent-based ingestion going forward.

What You'll Deliver

1. Connection layer between Postgres + Neo4j
   - Pull from Postgres (structured_content)
   - Transform data into JSON-ready format
   - Insert into Neo4j via Cypher queries
   - Follow best practices (MERGE, constraint setup, deduping)

2. Graph schema setup in Neo4j
   - Nodes: Article, Entity, Topic, Person, Company, etc.
   - Relationships: MENTIONS, TAGS, SIMILAR_TO, WRITTEN_BY, etc.
   - Constraints, indexing, uniqueness setup

3. MCP server setup
   - MCP Cypher Server running (local or containerized)
   - MCP Data Modeling server if schema support needed
   - Test calls (e.g. get_schema, write_cypher) with sample inputs

4. Documented pipeline for:
   - How to fetch Postgres data → transform → send to Claude/GPT for tagging
   - How to ingest into Neo4j using MCP server
   - How to run basic queries (match, update, etc.)


This is a modular setup. If this is well done, we'll bring you back for more advanced automations and integrations. This is 1 of many long term projects.

My Budget is 300$, with more neo4j projects to come.
