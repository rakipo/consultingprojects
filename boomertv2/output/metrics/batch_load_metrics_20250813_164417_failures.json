(Image credit: Getty Images) By Jared Trexler published 11 August 2025 in Features April 5 couldn't have been easy. Panic consumed the day after a near 6% S&P sell-off. But the American College of Financial Services' Advising Through Uncertainty Study has found that most financial professionals did their job in the days and weeks later \u2014 persuading their clients to stay calm and stay invested. Yet the study also indicates statistically significant divergences between portfolio change requests , anxieties and areas of focus between the clients of professionals who self-select as investment managers vs financial planners , as well as the American College of Financial Services designees vs non-designees. Before I let the data weave the story, here's the main takeaway: The value of an investment manager cloaked as a financial adviser is the portfolio (and for years, the access to capital markets it brought) .

Sign up The Kiplinger Building Wealth program handpicks financial advisers and business owners from around the world to share retirement, estate planning and tax strategies to preserve and grow your wealth. These experts, who never pay for inclusion on the site, include professional wealth managers, fiduciary financial planners, CPAs and lawyers. Most of them have certifications including CFP\u00ae, ChFC\u00ae, IAR, AIF\u00ae, CDFA\u00ae and more, and their stellar records can be checked through the SEC or FINRA . No matter the role a financial professional plays in a portfolio's success \u2014 akin to a professional football coach \u2014 they will garner the praise during an extended bull market and take it on the chin during inevitable market contractions. The value of the financial planner is generally more forward-looking and incorporates services beyond asset growth (or decline), including the tangible value provided through estate planning , income planning, charitable planning and tax planning, to name a few. Simply put, a true comprehensive financial planner can weather market gyrations because their 1% asset fee, or corresponding planning fee , is tied to tangible value outside what's discussed on Squawk Box each morning. An investment manager has a much more difficult story to tell if market volatility becomes something more prolonged, even though they had no sway in a presidential administration's policy choices. The all-weather financial planner Part of a financial adviser's value is in the positioning. Framing market drops as both an opportunity to buy at a discount and \"like any other day\" in a 30-year financial plan helps put short-term portfolio performance in context. The American College of Financial Services' study shows that advisers who always focus on financial planning are significantly less likely to field client requests to make portfolio changes (23%) than those who focus more on investment management (43%). This paradigm circles back to a common value exchange \u2014 if a singular value erodes, that's all the client can focus on. If the value is derived in multiple ways, losing one, hopefully briefly, can be more effectively explained. It's also, ironically enough, a better story to tell in attracting the assets that make up individual portfolios. In its report Financial Planning: Fueling Client and Business Growth , Cerulli Associates found private wealth managers who offer a \"complete suite of financial planning and investment services including charitable giving , stock option planning , and complex trust and estate planning\" attracted clients with assets under management (AUM) more than triple those of investment planners ($1.8 million vs $600,000 on average, respectively). Why do research study after research study find that a broader story resonates? One potential theory is one opined time and again by my former boss, Ed Slott , CPA, America's IRA expert. He'd start seminar after seminar for financial advisers with the calculus, \"The clients you want, the ones with money, they already have it.\" Those clients aren't looking for the next hot stock or the active management that beats the market. They want the planning value that makes that portfolio, well-earned over decades, resilient. Looking for expert tips to grow and preserve your wealth? Sign up for Building Wealth , our free, twice-weekly newsletter. It's not how much an adviser makes a client that demonstrates value that supersedes market volatility, but how much the adviser helps the client keep (tax planning), make last (income planning) and pass on ( charitable, legacy, estate planning ) that delivers on that 1% AUM or planning fee. The data dictates the right direction The Advising Through Uncertainty Study positions the all-weather financial professional as one who provides broad and specialized financial planning services \u2014 including those for which advisers attain specialized knowledge. Their clients exhibit less dramatic shifts in their feelings and behaviors during and/or immediately after market shocks, compared to those who rely on an adviser solely for investment management. In turn, not only are their clients less anxious and reactionary, but so are these financial planners. The survey asked advisers where they usually focus their attention, unrelated to recent uncertainty. Financial planners mostly or entirely focus on planning, while investment managers mostly or entirely focus on the portfolio. The data analyses compare these two segments and also examine key areas in which financial professionals who hold American College of Financial Services designations (i.e., designees) \u2014 such as the Chartered Financial Consultant \u00ae (ChFC \u00ae ), Retirement Income Certified Professional \u00ae (RICP \u00ae ) and Chartered Advisor in Philanthropy \u00ae (CAP \u00ae ) \u2014 differ from advisers without designations (i.e., non-designees). The study found that 45% of investment managers fielded client inquiries during this period of market uncertainty compared to 33% of financial planners. American College of Financial Services designees also experienced fewer portfolio revision requests (27%) than non-designees (37%); and only 26% of designees said client focus has centered on investments, vs 37% of non-designees. Key next steps for financial professionals Clients will naturally examine the value exchange with a fine-tooth comb when portfolios decline. Those portfolios are built on sacrifice, come attached to meaningful family legacies or philanthropic goals, and are the drivers of desired retirement plans . When the client thinks \u2014 or directly or indirectly \u2014 asks, \"What am I paying you for?\", take action today to have a confident answer tomorrow. Here are a few next steps: Consider the business case for true comprehensive planning, which requires not just service offerings, but the expertise to back them up. Adviser value is paid out on complexity, so having a true understanding of when and how to apply intricate concepts and communicate them effectively is what the service is really all about. Differentiation comes through competence and confidence. The survey revealed that, compared to advisers with no designations, financial professionals with American College of Financial Services designations were: Significantly less likely to say their clients were turning their focus to investments Significantly less likely to receive client requests to change their investments Significantly less likely to describe their clients as anxious This suggests not just an understanding, but also an acceptance from these clients to withstand fluctuating investment performance. Put market volatility and economic uncertainty in context. Simply put, communicate the complex like it's simple. Based on historical market performance, someone who started investing in their early 20s and planned to retire in their late 60s or early 70s (a 50-year investment time horizon) would live through about 14 bear markets, as Hartford Funds reminds us all in its 2025 Client Conversations . Competence is powered by the curiosity \u2014 and action \u2014 of lifelong learning. Communication is honed through both the confidence of doing it before, and the necessary shadowing of mentors and/or peers. The powerful combination of competence, confidence and communication takes time, but if the Advising Through Uncertainty Study is any indication, it pays powerful dividends before, during and after market volatility.

Subscribe Now Anthropic\u2019s meteoric rise to a $5 billion revenue run rate conceals a precarious dependence on just two major customers that account for nearly a quarter of the artificial intelligence company\u2019s income, according to internal data and industry analysis that reveals both the promise and peril of the AI coding boom. The San Francisco based maker of Claude AI assistant has built its business largely on the back of developer tools, with coding applications Cursor and GitHub Copilot driving approximately $1.2 billion of the company\u2019s $4 billion revenue milestone reached earlier this year, according to sources familiar with the matter. The concentration underscores how quickly Anthropic has captured the lucrative market for AI powered software development, but also exposes the company to significant risk should either relationship falter. OpenAI and Anthropic both are showing pretty spectacular growth in 2025, with OpenAI doubling ARR in the last 6 months from $6bn to $12bn and Anthropic increasing 5x from $1bn to $5bn in 7 months. If we compare the sources of revenue, the picture is quite interesting: \u2013 OpenAI\u2026 pic.twitter.com/8OaN1RSm9E \u2014 Peter Gostev (@petergostev) August 4, 2025 The revenue concentration comes into sharp focus as OpenAI launched GPT 5 this week with dramatically lower pricing that could undercut Anthropic\u2019s premium positioning. Early comparisons show Claude Opus 4 costs roughly seven times more per million tokens than GPT 5 for certain tasks, creating immediate pressure on Anthropic\u2019s enterprise pricing strategy and potentially threatening its hard won dominance in AI coding. The pricing disparity signals a fundamental shift in competitive dynamics that will force enterprise procurement teams to reconsider vendor relationships built on performance rather than price. Companies managing exponentially growing AI budgets now face comparable capability at a fraction of the cost, creating unavoidable pressure in contract negotiations.

(Credit: ChatGPT) How Anthropic\u2019s Claude became the developer\u2019s AI assistant of choice Anthropic\u2019s ascent reflects the explosive growth in AI powered software development, which has emerged as artificial intelligence\u2019s first truly profitable use case beyond chatbots. The company now commands 42% of the code generation market \u2014 more than double OpenAI\u2019s 21% share \u2014 according to a comprehensive survey by Menlo Ventures of 150 enterprise technical leaders. That dominance has translated into remarkable financial performance. Even excluding its two largest customers, Anthropic\u2019s remaining business has grown more than eleven fold year over year, according to a source close to the company. The startup has also tripled the number of eight and nine figure deals signed in 2025 compared to all of 2024, reflecting broader enterprise adoption beyond its coding strongholds. Claude\u2019s appeal to developers stems from its superior performance on complex coding tasks. The newly released Claude Opus 4.1 scores 74.5% on SWE bench Verified , a rigorous software engineering evaluation, compared to 69.1% for OpenAI\u2019s previous flagship model. Companies like Windsurf , Cursor , and GitHub have praised Claude\u2019s ability to handle multi step coding problems and understand large codebases. \u201cPeople love Claude Code, they love using models to write code, and these models are already extremely good and getting better,\u201d said Logan Graham , a member of Anthropic\u2019s frontier red team, in a recent interview with VentureBeat describing the surge in AI assisted development. But the concentration in coding partnerships also creates strategic vulnerabilities. GitHub Copilot , owned by Microsoft , represents a particularly complex relationship given Microsoft\u2019s $13 billion investment in OpenAI . The partnership requires Anthropic to power a competitor\u2019s key product while relying on that same competitor\u2019s parent company for a significant portion of revenue. OpenAI strikes back with aggressive GPT 5 pricing strategy targeting Anthropic OpenAI\u2019s GPT 5 launch this week has introduced a new variable into Anthropic\u2019s calculations: a dramatic pricing advantage that could reshape enterprise buying decisions. Early analysis shows GPT 5 offering comparable or superior performance at a fraction of Claude\u2019s cost, potentially undermining the premium pricing that has driven Anthropic\u2019s rapid revenue growth. The timing proves particularly challenging as Anthropic seeks to close a funding round that could value the company at $170 billion . Investors will likely scrutinize both the customer concentration and the emerging price competition as they evaluate whether Anthropic can maintain its growth trajectory. The broader market dynamics support both optimism and concern for Anthropic\u2019s future. Model API spending has more than doubled to $8.4 billion in just six months, according to Menlo Ventures , as enterprises shift from experimental projects to production deployments. Anthropic has captured 32% of overall enterprise large language model usage, ahead of OpenAI\u2019s 25% and Google\u2019s 20%. However, the same report reveals that enterprises consistently prioritize performance over price , upgrading to the newest models within weeks of release regardless of cost. This behavior pattern suggests that GPT 5\u2019s combination of improved performance and lower pricing could trigger rapid customer migration \u2014 exactly the scenario that makes Anthropic\u2019s customer concentration so risky. Anthropic\u2019s push beyond coding into enterprise markets Anthropic has attempted to diversify beyond coding applications, working with leading companies across pharmaceuticals, retail, professional services, and aviation. The European Parliament uses Claude, while major corporations like Pfizer , United Airlines , and Thomson Reuters have become customers. Startup successes include legal AI company Harvey and cybersecurity firm Base44 . The company\u2019s business to business revenue run rate has grown seventeen fold year over year as of June, suggesting broader enterprise adoption is accelerating. Claude Code , Anthropic\u2019s developer focused product, alone generates nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, doubling in just weeks according to industry reports. Yet the coding market remains central to Anthropic\u2019s identity and growth strategy. The company has invested heavily in developer tools, recently launching automated security review capabilities to address vulnerabilities in AI generated code. The features arrive as companies increasingly rely on AI to write code faster than traditional security practices can accommodate. \u201cIt seems really possible that in the next couple of years, we are going to 10x, 100x, 1000x the amount of code that gets written in the world,\u201d Graham recently told VentureBeat. \u201cThe only way to keep up is by using models themselves to figure out how to make it secure.\u201d Anthropic\u2019s customer concentration creates high stakes dependencies The convergence of customer concentration and pricing pressure places Anthropic at a strategic crossroads. The company must simultaneously defend its existing coding partnerships while expanding into new markets, all while potentially restructuring its pricing to remain competitive with GPT 5. The challenge extends beyond simple price matching. Anthropic has positioned Claude as a premium product justified by superior performance and safety features. Dramatic price cuts could undermine that positioning while potentially triggering a broader industry price war that benefits no one except customers. Moreover, the customer concentration in coding partnerships creates both leverage and vulnerability. While Cursor and GitHub Copilot relationships provide stable, high volume revenue streams, they also mean Anthropic\u2019s fate partially rests in the hands of companies that could switch providers with relatively little friction. The GitHub relationship proves particularly complex given Microsoft\u2019s competing interests. As GitHub Copilot grows more successful, Microsoft faces increasing pressure to integrate its own OpenAI partnership more deeply, potentially displacing Anthropic despite Claude\u2019s current performance advantages. Industry observers note that model switching costs remain relatively low, with 66% of enterprises upgrading within existing providers rather than switching vendors. However, the dramatic price differential introduced by GPT 5 could overcome typical switching inertia, especially for cost conscious enterprises facing budget pressures. The talent wars and competitive dynamics reshaping AI Anthropic\u2019s customer concentration challenge reflects broader dynamics reshaping the AI industry as competition intensifies among frontier model developers. OpenAI\u2019s aggressive GPT 5 pricing suggests a strategy to reclaim market share lost to Anthropic and other competitors, even at the expense of near term revenue. The timing coincides with an unprecedented talent war among AI companies, with Meta reportedly offering $100 million signing bonuses to poach key researchers. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently noted that many employees have turned down such offers , maintaining an 80% retention rate compared to 67% at OpenAI and 64% at Meta. However, the pricing pressure from GPT 5 could force Anthropic to accelerate its own talent investments and product development cycles, potentially straining the company\u2019s financial resources despite its impressive revenue growth. The need to match OpenAI\u2019s pricing while maintaining research and development spending could squeeze margins and complicate the ongoing funding round. Enterprise customers, meanwhile, benefit from the intensifying competition through better performance and lower costs. The rapid pace of model improvements \u2014 with new versions launching monthly rather than annually \u2014 provides enterprises with continuously improving capabilities while vendors compete aggressively for their business. For Anthropic, the path forward requires careful navigation between protecting existing customer relationships and expanding market reach, all while responding to OpenAI\u2019s pricing offensive. The company\u2019s ability to maintain its coding market leadership while diversifying revenue sources may determine whether its remarkable growth story continues or becomes a cautionary tale about the perils of customer concentration in rapidly evolving markets. The stakes extend beyond any single company\u2019s fortunes. As AI powered coding becomes central to software development across industries, the competitive dynamics between Anthropic and OpenAI will shape how quickly artificial intelligence transforms one of the economy\u2019s most important sectors. For now, the battle lines are drawn around price and performance, with enterprises holding the ultimate power to determine which AI assistant will define the future of software development.

Subscribe Now Anthropic\u2019s meteoric rise to a $5 billion revenue run rate conceals a precarious dependence on just two major customers that account for nearly a quarter of the artificial intelligence company\u2019s income, according to internal data and industry analysis that reveals both the promise and peril of the AI coding boom. The San Francisco based maker of Claude AI assistant has built its business largely on the back of developer tools, with coding applications Cursor and GitHub Copilot driving approximately $1.2 billion of the company\u2019s $4 billion revenue milestone reached earlier this year, according to sources familiar with the matter. The concentration underscores how quickly Anthropic has captured the lucrative market for AI powered software development, but also exposes the company to significant risk should either relationship falter. OpenAI and Anthropic both are showing pretty spectacular growth in 2025, with OpenAI doubling ARR in the last 6 months from $6bn to $12bn and Anthropic increasing 5x from $1bn to $5bn in 7 months. If we compare the sources of revenue, the picture is quite interesting: \u2013 OpenAI\u2026 pic.twitter.com/8OaN1RSm9E \u2014 Peter Gostev (@petergostev) August 4, 2025 The revenue concentration comes into sharp focus as OpenAI launched GPT 5 this week with dramatically lower pricing that could undercut Anthropic\u2019s premium positioning. Early comparisons show Claude Opus 4 costs roughly seven times more per million tokens than GPT 5 for certain tasks, creating immediate pressure on Anthropic\u2019s enterprise pricing strategy and potentially threatening its hard won dominance in AI coding. The pricing disparity signals a fundamental shift in competitive dynamics that will force enterprise procurement teams to reconsider vendor relationships built on performance rather than price. Companies managing exponentially growing AI budgets now face comparable capability at a fraction of the cost, creating unavoidable pressure in contract negotiations.

(Credit: ChatGPT) How Anthropic\u2019s Claude became the developer\u2019s AI assistant of choice Anthropic\u2019s ascent reflects the explosive growth in AI powered software development, which has emerged as artificial intelligence\u2019s first truly profitable use case beyond chatbots. The company now commands 42% of the code generation market \u2014 more than double OpenAI\u2019s 21% share \u2014 according to a comprehensive survey by Menlo Ventures of 150 enterprise technical leaders. That dominance has translated into remarkable financial performance. Even excluding its two largest customers, Anthropic\u2019s remaining business has grown more than eleven fold year over year, according to a source close to the company. The startup has also tripled the number of eight and nine figure deals signed in 2025 compared to all of 2024, reflecting broader enterprise adoption beyond its coding strongholds. Claude\u2019s appeal to developers stems from its superior performance on complex coding tasks. The newly released Claude Opus 4.1 scores 74.5% on SWE bench Verified , a rigorous software engineering evaluation, compared to 69.1% for OpenAI\u2019s previous flagship model. Companies like Windsurf , Cursor , and GitHub have praised Claude\u2019s ability to handle multi step coding problems and understand large codebases. \u201cPeople love Claude Code, they love using models to write code, and these models are already extremely good and getting better,\u201d said Logan Graham , a member of Anthropic\u2019s frontier red team, in a recent interview with VentureBeat describing the surge in AI assisted development. But the concentration in coding partnerships also creates strategic vulnerabilities. GitHub Copilot , owned by Microsoft , represents a particularly complex relationship given Microsoft\u2019s $13 billion investment in OpenAI . The partnership requires Anthropic to power a competitor\u2019s key product while relying on that same competitor\u2019s parent company for a significant portion of revenue. OpenAI strikes back with aggressive GPT 5 pricing strategy targeting Anthropic OpenAI\u2019s GPT 5 launch this week has introduced a new variable into Anthropic\u2019s calculations: a dramatic pricing advantage that could reshape enterprise buying decisions. Early analysis shows GPT 5 offering comparable or superior performance at a fraction of Claude\u2019s cost, potentially undermining the premium pricing that has driven Anthropic\u2019s rapid revenue growth. The timing proves particularly challenging as Anthropic seeks to close a funding round that could value the company at $170 billion . Investors will likely scrutinize both the customer concentration and the emerging price competition as they evaluate whether Anthropic can maintain its growth trajectory. The broader market dynamics support both optimism and concern for Anthropic\u2019s future. Model API spending has more than doubled to $8.4 billion in just six months, according to Menlo Ventures , as enterprises shift from experimental projects to production deployments. Anthropic has captured 32% of overall enterprise large language model usage, ahead of OpenAI\u2019s 25% and Google\u2019s 20%. However, the same report reveals that enterprises consistently prioritize performance over price , upgrading to the newest models within weeks of release regardless of cost. This behavior pattern suggests that GPT 5\u2019s combination of improved performance and lower pricing could trigger rapid customer migration \u2014 exactly the scenario that makes Anthropic\u2019s customer concentration so risky. Anthropic\u2019s push beyond coding into enterprise markets Anthropic has attempted to diversify beyond coding applications, working with leading companies across pharmaceuticals, retail, professional services, and aviation. The European Parliament uses Claude, while major corporations like Pfizer , United Airlines , and Thomson Reuters have become customers. Startup successes include legal AI company Harvey and cybersecurity firm Base44 . The company\u2019s business to business revenue run rate has grown seventeen fold year over year as of June, suggesting broader enterprise adoption is accelerating. Claude Code , Anthropic\u2019s developer focused product, alone generates nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, doubling in just weeks according to industry reports. Yet the coding market remains central to Anthropic\u2019s identity and growth strategy. The company has invested heavily in developer tools, recently launching automated security review capabilities to address vulnerabilities in AI generated code. The features arrive as companies increasingly rely on AI to write code faster than traditional security practices can accommodate. \u201cIt seems really possible that in the next couple of years, we are going to 10x, 100x, 1000x the amount of code that gets written in the world,\u201d Graham recently told VentureBeat. \u201cThe only way to keep up is by using models themselves to figure out how to make it secure.\u201d Anthropic\u2019s customer concentration creates high stakes dependencies The convergence of customer concentration and pricing pressure places Anthropic at a strategic crossroads. The company must simultaneously defend its existing coding partnerships while expanding into new markets, all while potentially restructuring its pricing to remain competitive with GPT 5. The challenge extends beyond simple price matching. Anthropic has positioned Claude as a premium product justified by superior performance and safety features. Dramatic price cuts could undermine that positioning while potentially triggering a broader industry price war that benefits no one except customers. Moreover, the customer concentration in coding partnerships creates both leverage and vulnerability. While Cursor and GitHub Copilot relationships provide stable, high volume revenue streams, they also mean Anthropic\u2019s fate partially rests in the hands of companies that could switch providers with relatively little friction. The GitHub relationship proves particularly complex given Microsoft\u2019s competing interests. As GitHub Copilot grows more successful, Microsoft faces increasing pressure to integrate its own OpenAI partnership more deeply, potentially displacing Anthropic despite Claude\u2019s current performance advantages. Industry observers note that model switching costs remain relatively low, with 66% of enterprises upgrading within existing providers rather than switching vendors. However, the dramatic price differential introduced by GPT 5 could overcome typical switching inertia, especially for cost conscious enterprises facing budget pressures. The talent wars and competitive dynamics reshaping AI Anthropic\u2019s customer concentration challenge reflects broader dynamics reshaping the AI industry as competition intensifies among frontier model developers. OpenAI\u2019s aggressive GPT 5 pricing suggests a strategy to reclaim market share lost to Anthropic and other competitors, even at the expense of near term revenue. The timing coincides with an unprecedented talent war among AI companies, with Meta reportedly offering $100 million signing bonuses to poach key researchers. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently noted that many employees have turned down such offers , maintaining an 80% retention rate compared to 67% at OpenAI and 64% at Meta. However, the pricing pressure from GPT 5 could force Anthropic to accelerate its own talent investments and product development cycles, potentially straining the company\u2019s financial resources despite its impressive revenue growth. The need to match OpenAI\u2019s pricing while maintaining research and development spending could squeeze margins and complicate the ongoing funding round. Enterprise customers, meanwhile, benefit from the intensifying competition through better performance and lower costs. The rapid pace of model improvements \u2014 with new versions launching monthly rather than annually \u2014 provides enterprises with continuously improving capabilities while vendors compete aggressively for their business. For Anthropic, the path forward requires careful navigation between protecting existing customer relationships and expanding market reach, all while responding to OpenAI\u2019s pricing offensive. The company\u2019s ability to maintain its coding market leadership while diversifying revenue sources may determine whether its remarkable growth story continues or becomes a cautionary tale about the perils of customer concentration in rapidly evolving markets. The stakes extend beyond any single company\u2019s fortunes. As AI powered coding becomes central to software development across industries, the competitive dynamics between Anthropic and OpenAI will shape how quickly artificial intelligence transforms one of the economy\u2019s most important sectors. For now, the battle lines are drawn around price and performance, with enterprises holding the ultimate power to determine which AI assistant will define the future of software development.
