Private market assets bring diversification to investment portfolios, advocates say, and the chance for higher returns. But some financial advisors say the complexity, illiquidity and high fees may make these investments unsuitable for many investors. Johner Images | Johner Images Royalty-free | Getty Images Investors may soon have greater access to private assets \u2014 that is, investments that are not publicly traded \u2014 in their 401(k) or other workplace retirement plans. Financial advisors say that for many workers, the risks may outweigh the rewards. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to increase the availability of alternative assets in 401(k) plans. The order instructs the Department of Labor to reexamine its guidance to employers and plan administrators on incorporating such assets into retirement plans. Alternative investments are a broad category that includes real estate, cryptocurrencies and private-market assets, among others. That last subset, also called private assets, can include equity and credit in private (not publicly traded) firms. Pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds and high-net-worth individuals are traditional investors in these private markets. watch now VIDEO 3:46 03:46 Opening 401(k)s to private markets: Here's what to know Squawk Box Although an executive order to independent agencies does not change policy, it is a strong signal of Trump's priorities and support of alternative investments in retirement plans. During Trump's first term, the Labor Department issued an information letter to plan fiduciaries, telling them that private equity may be part of a \"prudent investment mix\" in a professionally managed asset allocation fund in a 401(k) plan. Fiduciaries have a legal and ethical obligation to work in the best interest of investors by considering the risk of loss and potential gains associated with investments. Thursday's order instructs the Labor Department to clarify its position on the appropriate fiduciary process associated with such funds. Some financial advisors are concerned that 401(k) investors lack the knowledge or experience to incorporate these more sophisticated, and often more costly, investments into their portfolios. \"When you have an unsophisticated investor that doesn't even understand the difference between a stock and a bond, and now all of a sudden you introduce the allure of getting rich in the private equity markets. You're only asking for trouble,\" said Charles Massimo, a Long Island, New York-based financial advisor and senior vice president at Wealth Enhancement. Pros and cons of private assets in 401(k)s Retirement plans represent a significant market. Defined-contribution workplace plans \u2014 which include 401(k)s and 403(b) plans, among others \u2014 held $12.2 trillion as of the end of the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade association. About $8.7 trillion is in 401(k)s alone. Advocates' argument for incorporating such investments in workplace retirement plans is that they could provide retail investors with more diversification away from public markets, and a chance for higher returns. \"Retirement savers are the ultimate long-term investors and would benefit from the diversification offered by the inclusion of private assets,\" Melissa Barosy, a spokesperson for the Investment Company Institute, said in an email. watch now VIDEO 4:02 04:02 Private equity in retirement plans: Here's what 401(k) owners need to know Power Lunch But such investments are complex . Investors may be restricted in their ability to cash out, experts say, and fees tend to be high. The average exchange-traded fund carries a 0.51% annual management fee, about half the 1.01% fee of the average mutual fund, according to Morningstar data. Private equity firms typically collect a 2% management fee, plus 20% of the profit. \"If you're going to introduce these types of investments, you really have to have a concerted effort to be educating both plan sponsors and retirement investors about what these things are,\"\u00a0 said Lisa Gomez, who served under the Biden administration as Assistant Secretary for Employee Benefits Security, the Department of Labor division that oversees private-sector workplace retirement plans.

Here\u2019s why Investing in uncertain times: Here's what investors should know Private equity wants a larger piece of workplace retirement plan assets Unlike publicly-traded assets, basic information on private equity investments \u2014 like what firms are in a fund and what their revenues and losses are \u2014 can be challenging to obtain. \"The rules aren't as standard with private investments,\" said Chris Noble, policy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog organization. That makes it hard to compare the values of private versus public assets. \"I'd argue, because of that, [401(k) investors] are just fine with stock and bonds,\" said Noble. Some experts also question the quality of those private assets that could be offered to retirement investors. Say you're a major player in private assets, said financial advisor Massimo. In that scenario, he said, \"I'm saving the best deals for my highest clients. It's the deals I really can't sell that I'm going to funnel off down to the participants that may not understand it or see it.\" The law governing 401(k) plans requires plan sponsors to act as fiduciaries . However, the Department of Labor could issue guidance stating that alternative investments meet this obligation, which would help shield employers from lawsuits, experts say. \"It also could reassure plan advisers that they will not face litigation for including alternatives in retirement accounts even though they are less liquid,\" Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst for TD Cowen, wrote in a policy note on July 16. Private assets may be slow to 'gain traction' Private equity firms, including Apollo Global Management, BlackRock, Blackstone, and KKR have introduced new products to make inroads into defined contribution plans. Several 401(k) plan administrators are already making private assets available to their participants. Retirement service provider Empower, which has 19 million plan participants, recently announced plans to introduce private investments in its offerings. \"This will be a pivotal moment in the evolution of retirement planning,\" Empower president and CEO Edmund F. Murphy III said in a statement to CNBC. \"Opening the door to responsibly managed alternative investments such as private equity, private credit and private real estate and digital assets like cryptocurrency, we can offer everyday savers access to a broader array of investment types.\" watch now VIDEO 3:43 03:43 Rodriques: Index funds for private markets are coming later this year Worldwide Exchange Retirement plan administrators are likely to move slowly to add private asset investment options due to the complexity of evaluating private assets. \"It will take 36 to 60 months to really gain traction,\" said Russ Ivinjack, the global chief investment officer at Aon. \"Fiduciaries are incredibly deliberate.\" Experts say the early private investment offerings could appear in target-date funds. Those funds contain a mix of investments that shift over time as a specified retirement date approaches. Proponents say that target-date funds offer managers the flexibility to adjust asset allocations and incorporate lower-cost index funds into the mix to offset the higher costs of private assets.

What should I do with this money? 'I don't know anything about investing': I'm inheriting a $150,000 IRA. What should I do with this money? Provided by Dow Jones Aug 11, 2025, 10:32:00 AM By Quentin Fottrell 'I will have 10 years to complete the withdrawals' \"I will have 10 years to complete the withdrawals.\" (Photo subject is a model.) Dear Quentin, I will soon inherit an IRA account. I'm in my 50s. My share will be about $150,000. I will have 10 years to complete the withdrawals. I don't know anything about investing and I'm not interested in doing my own investing. What recommendations do you have to set it and forget it? Expecting a Windfall Don't miss: 'The sky has not fallen - yet': Is it time to start worrying about a U.S. recession? Not keeping an eye on your portfolio is not a good idea. Dear Expecting, Given that you are sharing this IRA, I assume you are not the spouse of the deceased. That being the case, if the late owner has not yet taken their RMDs, Charles Schwab (SCHW) says you have three penalty-free options: 1) transfer the assets into an inherited IRA in your name (RMDs must begin no later than 12/31 of the year after death); 2) open an inherited IRA with the 10-year method (the money is available until 12/31 of the 10th year after the year the account holder died, after which all RMDs must take place); or 3) take a lump sum (with a high tax bracket). If the late owner had already started taking RMDs, new rules, which went into effect in 2025, state that you, as the non-spouse who inherited the IRA, must take an RMD each year, beginning the year after the original account owner's death. This applies to accounts that have been inherited since 2020. These RMDs are subject to the 10-year distribution rule, meaning the account should be emptied by the 10th year after the owner's death. What happens next depends on whether the original owner had already started taking RMDs. If you invest $100,000 in the S&P 500 SPX, with a 7% average return, expect to earn $387,000 over 20 years. The 60/40 rule recommends 60% stocks - say, an S&P 500 ETF, representing 500 of the largest U.S. companies, dividend stocks with 15% international equity exposure - and 30% in bonds and 10% in cash/cash alternatives for liquidity, in case of unexpected events, like CDs or high-yield savings accounts. It splits your money into higher/lower risk vehicles. There is one key difference between CDs and high-yield savings accounts: The latter are more liquid, meaning you can take your money out more easily. Typically, withdrawals are limited to half a dozen per month. With CDs, you are committing to a set interest rate. But interest rates can change with high-yield savings accounts - even after you deposit your money -  based on the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate. Clouds on the horizon With President Donald Trump's trade war and the as-yet unforeseen impact of his tariffs on the imports and price of goods, and the Federal Reserve's changeable - and currently cautious - approach to interest-rate policy, there is always the risk of an economic downturn or even a recession. A softening in the labor market is a worry. The economy added just 73,000 new jobs in July, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, up from 4.1% in June. It's, perhaps, not all clouds on the horizon: Gross domestic product rose by 3% on the year in the second quarter after slipping by 0.5% in the first quarter. That figure came at a price, however, and was due in part to a smaller trade deficit as higher tariffs stymied demand for imports. One way to \"set it and forget it\" involves having a risk profile commensurate with your age and having confidence that a diversified portfolio will see you safely over the long term. One way to 'set it and forget it' involves having a risk profile commensurate with your age. Given the gap between first- and second-quarter GDP, all eyes will be on third-quarter GDP. A recession is often defined as a fall in GDP in two consecutive quarters. Trump, meanwhile, has made clear that he believes interest rates are still high and has put pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates. Sales at retailers also rebounded last month, and Powell is cautious not to reignite the era of high inflation seen earlier this decade. A semi-conservative approach for someone approaching midlife: You could also put a third in a Fidelity Intermediate Bond Fund FTHRX, which invests in U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade bonds and maintains a dollar-weighted average; a Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond Index Fund VICBX, which invests 50% of assets in corporate bonds and 50% in U.S. government bonds; and/or a iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF AGG. Protecting your financial future Put money aside for an emergency that should last from six months to a year. If you are happy with your current mortgage rate and monthly repayments, assuming you would have mentioned it if this was a concern for you, investing this money in a \"set it and forget it\" policy (at least until you are near retirement age) is a wise move. But such a strategy should also allow for you to revisit your allocations every year or so; not keeping an eye on your portfolio is not a good idea. You may also wish to consider long-term-care insurance. For a $165,000-benefit policy with no inflation protection, it would cost roughly $950 for a single male (aged 55) and $1,500 for a single female (aged 55), according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance. Those premiums will rise as you get older. Still, you could put that on the back burner until you are turning 60. An estimated 70% of Americans will require long-term care. Long-term-care insurance can go up as you age, but you can customize the kind of policy you sign up for. Such decisions should be taken under the guidance of a trusted adviser. Long-term-care insurance can go up as you age, but you can customize the kind of policy you sign up for. \"Repeated government efforts to create a functioning market for long-term care insurance - or to provide public alternatives - have never taken hold,\" according to this guidance from KFF Health News, which is part of the nonprofit organization KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"Today, most insurers have stopped selling stand-alone long-term care policies,\" it adds. \"The ones that still exist are too expensive for most people. And they have become less affordable each year, with insurers raising premiums higher and higher. Many policyholders face painful choices to pay more, pare benefits, or drop coverage altogether. In other cases, people entitled to benefits confront lengthy response times to coverage requests or outright denials.\" See this $150,000 as an opportunity rather than a curse.

Aging is the strongest risk factor for medical conditions that predominately account for morbidity, mortality, and health care costs: cancer, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and neurodegenerative disease. The geroscience hypothesis postulates that mechanisms of aging simultaneously drive multiple chronic illnesses and functional decline/disability, and intervening in the rate of aging can prevent multiple diseases. Geroscience now relies on 12 identified \"hallmarks\" or \"pillars\" of aging that involve alterations in genomic stability/repair, telomere length, epigenetics, proteostasis, macroautophagy, nutrient-sensing, mitochondrial function, cellular senescence, stem cell regeneration, intercellular communication, inflammation, and the microbiome. These pillars are mechanisms/pathways associated with aging, and evidence for causal associations is rapidly becoming more robust. Geroscience-based interventions may reduce illness burden-preserving function and independence-to a greater degree than addressing illnesses one by one. However, the pathway from promise to success is riddled with obstacles and potential pitfalls. Even success can have negative impacts on human populations and our planet that will require major shifts in society. Both the promises and perils of geroscience are likely to shape medical research and ethical debate for years to come. \u00a9 2025 The American Clinical and Climatological Association.

Human survival curves over time. Survival of a substantial population into a second half century is a relatively new event in human history.

The geroscience hypothesis, interventions, and chronic disease/disability prevention. The hallmarks of aging (HoA) are cellular mechanisms associated with aging; enhancing these pathways speeds aging, while mitigating these pathways slows the development of age-related disease and functional decline (4). Identifying interventions informed by the HoA may (a) lead to globally slower aging and simultaneous reductions in multiple diseases at the same time or (b) suggest critical interventions for disease-specific therapy/prevention.

The Health ABC Modified Physiological index predicts mortality in older adults. This composite index, a simple, five-component score [based on tertiles of systolic blood pressure, forced vital capacity, digit symbol substitution test, cystatin-C, and specific cut points for serum fasting glucose (<126; 126\u2013142; >142)], is normally distributed in adults ages 70\u201379 years and strongly predicts mortality (and incident disability, not shown) over a mean follow-up of 9.34 (\u00b12.85) years (34). The hazard ratio for mortality after multivariate adjustment was 1.19 for each one-point increase in the index (95% CI 1.14\u20131.24). Fig. 5. Modeling of total government (Medicare,\u2026 Fig. 5.

A 20% decline in the rate of aging over 30 years (2020 to 2050; average lifespan expectancy increases 2.2 years) modeled versus 2010 data would significantly increase government outlays due to an increased number of recipients despite projected reductions in health care costs.

Scenario Projections Methodology and Research Studies Technical Panel Reports Beneficiary Income and Out-of-Pocket Costs Trustees Report & Trust Funds The Medicare Program is the second-largest social insurance program in the U.S., with\u00a067.6 million beneficiaries and total expenditures of just over $1.1 trillion in 2024. The Boards of Trustees for Medicare (also Boards) report annually to the Congress on the financial operations and actuarial status of the program. Beginning in 2002, there is one combined report discussing both the Hospital Insurance program (Medicare Part A) and the Supplementary Medical Insurance program (Medicare Part B and Prescription Drug Coverage). The Office of the Actuary in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) prepares the report under the direction of the Boards. The Boards of Trustees issued their most recent report on June 18, 2025.\u00a0(See downloads below.) The Trustees Report is a detailed, lengthy document, containing a substantial amount of information on the past and estimated future financial operations of the Hospital Insurance and Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds (see the links in the Downloads section below). We recommend that readers begin with the \"Overview\" section of the report. This section is fairly short, is written in \"plain English,\" and summarizes all the key information concerning the expected financial outlook for Medicare. Substantial additional material is available in the later sections for those wishing to delve more deeply into the actuarial projections. The following expanded and supplementary tables and figures have been provided to accompany the report. (See downloads below.)

These comprehensive reports are prepared by the Boards of Trustees for the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Part A) and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund (Parts B and D).\n\nThe Trustees Reports serve as the official government assessment of Medicare's financial outlook and are required by law to be submitted to Congress each year. The reports analyze the financial operations of the Medicare trust funds, including income, expenditures, and projected future financial status under current law.\n\nEach report contains detailed actuarial and financial data, including projections extending 75 years into the future. The reports examine factors affecting Medicare's financial status, such as demographic changes, healthcare cost trends, and legislative changes. They also provide recommendations for ensuring the long-term financial sustainability of the Medicare program.\n\nThe Hospital Insurance Trust Fund finances Medicare Part A benefits, which primarily cover inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility care, hospice care, and some home health services. The Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund has two separate accounts: Part B, which covers physician services, outpatient hospital services, and other medical services; and Part D, which covers prescription drug benefits.\n\nThe Trustees Reports are prepared with input from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Social Security Administration, and the Department of Health and Human Services. The reports undergo rigorous review by independent actuaries and are considered the authoritative source for information about Medicare's financial status.\n\nThese reports are essential tools for policymakers, researchers, and the public to understand Medicare's current financial condition and long-term sustainability challenges. They provide the factual foundation for policy discussions about potential reforms to ensure Medicare's continued ability to serve beneficiaries.",

Report & Trust Funds Pages in this section Trustees Report & Trust Funds Trustees Reports (current and prior) About the Board of Trustees Time-to-Death Demographic Factors Illustrative Alternative Scenario Projections Methodology and Research Studies Technical Panel Reports Beneficiary Income and Out-of-Pocket Costs Trustees Report & Trust Funds The Medicare Program is the second-largest social insurance program in the U.S., with\u00a067.6 million beneficiaries and total expenditures of just over $1.1 trillion in 2024. The Boards of Trustees for Medicare (also Boards) report annually to the Congress on the financial operations and actuarial status of the program. Beginning in 2002, there is one combined report discussing both the Hospital Insurance program (Medicare Part A) and the Supplementary Medical Insurance program (Medicare Part B and Prescription Drug Coverage). The Office of the Actuary in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) prepares the report under the direction of the Boards. The Boards of Trustees issued their most recent report on June 18, 2025.\u00a0(See downloads below.) The Trustees Report is a detailed, lengthy document, containing a substantial amount of information on the past and estimated future financial operations of the Hospital Insurance and Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds (see the links in the Downloads section below). We recommend that readers begin with the \"Overview\" section of the report. This section is fairly short, is written in \"plain English,\" and summarizes all the key information concerning the expected financial outlook for Medicare.

These comprehensive reports are prepared by the Boards of Trustees for the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Part A) and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund (Parts B and D).\n\nThe Trustees Reports serve as the official government assessment of Medicare's financial outlook and are required by law to be submitted to Congress each year. The reports analyze the financial operations of the Medicare trust funds, including income, expenditures, and projected future financial status under current law.\n\nEach report contains detailed actuarial and financial data, including projections extending 75 years into the future. The reports examine factors affecting Medicare's financial status, such as demographic changes, healthcare cost trends, and legislative changes. They also provide recommendations for ensuring the long-term financial sustainability of the Medicare program.\n\nThe Hospital Insurance Trust Fund finances Medicare Part A benefits, which primarily cover inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility care, hospice care, and some home health services. The Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund has two separate accounts: Part B, which covers physician services, outpatient hospital services, and other medical services; and Part D, which covers prescription drug benefits.\n\nThe Trustees Reports are prepared with input from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Social Security Administration, and the Department of Health and Human Services. The reports undergo rigorous review by independent actuaries and are considered the authoritative source for information about Medicare's financial status.\n\nThese reports are essential tools for policymakers, researchers, and the public to understand Medicare's current financial condition and long-term sustainability challenges. They provide the factual foundation for policy discussions about potential reforms to ensure Medicare's continued ability to serve beneficiaries.",

Private market assets bring diversification to investment portfolios, advocates say, and the chance for higher returns. But some financial advisors say the complexity, illiquidity and high fees may make these investments unsuitable for many investors. Johner Images | Johner Images Royalty-free | Getty Images Investors may soon have greater access to private assets \u2014 that is, investments that are not publicly traded \u2014 in their 401(k) or other workplace retirement plans. Financial advisors say that for many workers, the risks may outweigh the rewards. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to increase the availability of alternative assets in 401(k) plans. The order instructs the Department of Labor to reexamine its guidance to employers and plan administrators on incorporating such assets into retirement plans. Alternative investments are a broad category that includes real estate, cryptocurrencies and private-market assets, among others. That last subset, also called private assets, can include equity and credit in private (not publicly traded) firms. Pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds and high-net-worth individuals are traditional investors in these private markets. watch now VIDEO 3:46 03:46 Opening 401(k)s to private markets: Here's what to know Squawk Box Although an executive order to independent agencies does not change policy, it is a strong signal of Trump's priorities and support of alternative investments in retirement plans. During Trump's first term, the Labor Department issued an information letter to plan fiduciaries, telling them that private equity may be part of a \"prudent investment mix\" in a professionally managed asset allocation fund in a 401(k) plan. Fiduciaries have a legal and ethical obligation to work in the best interest of investors by considering the risk of loss and potential gains associated with investments. Thursday's order instructs the Labor Department to clarify its position on the appropriate fiduciary process associated with such funds. Some financial advisors are concerned that 401(k) investors lack the knowledge or experience to incorporate these more sophisticated, and often more costly, investments into their portfolios. \"When you have an unsophisticated investor that doesn't even understand the difference between a stock and a bond, and now all of a sudden you introduce the allure of getting rich in the private equity markets. You're only asking for trouble,\" said Charles Massimo, a Long Island, New York-based financial advisor and senior vice president at Wealth Enhancement. Pros and cons of private assets in 401(k)s Retirement plans represent a significant market. Defined-contribution workplace plans \u2014 which include 401(k)s and 403(b) plans, among others \u2014 held $12.2 trillion as of the end of the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade association. About $8.7 trillion is in 401(k)s alone. Advocates' argument for incorporating such investments in workplace retirement plans is that they could provide retail investors with more diversification away from public markets, and a chance for higher returns. \"Retirement savers are the ultimate long-term investors and would benefit from the diversification offered by the inclusion of private assets,\" Melissa Barosy, a spokesperson for the Investment Company Institute, said in an email. watch now VIDEO 4:02 04:02 Private equity in retirement plans: Here's what 401(k) owners need to know Power Lunch But such investments are complex . Investors may be restricted in their ability to cash out, experts say, and fees tend to be high. The average exchange-traded fund carries a 0.51% annual management fee, about half the 1.01% fee of the average mutual fund, according to Morningstar data. Private equity firms typically collect a 2% management fee, plus 20% of the profit. \"If you're going to introduce these types of investments, you really have to have a concerted effort to be educating both plan sponsors and retirement investors about what these things are,\"\u00a0 said Lisa Gomez, who served under the Biden administration as Assistant Secretary for Employee Benefits Security, the Department of Labor division that oversees private-sector workplace retirement plans.

Here\u2019s why Investing in uncertain times: Here's what investors should know Private equity wants a larger piece of workplace retirement plan assets Unlike publicly-traded assets, basic information on private equity investments \u2014 like what firms are in a fund and what their revenues and losses are \u2014 can be challenging to obtain. \"The rules aren't as standard with private investments,\" said Chris Noble, policy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog organization. That makes it hard to compare the values of private versus public assets. \"I'd argue, because of that, [401(k) investors] are just fine with stock and bonds,\" said Noble. Some experts also question the quality of those private assets that could be offered to retirement investors. Say you're a major player in private assets, said financial advisor Massimo. In that scenario, he said, \"I'm saving the best deals for my highest clients. It's the deals I really can't sell that I'm going to funnel off down to the participants that may not understand it or see it.\" The law governing 401(k) plans requires plan sponsors to act as fiduciaries . However, the Department of Labor could issue guidance stating that alternative investments meet this obligation, which would help shield employers from lawsuits, experts say. \"It also could reassure plan advisers that they will not face litigation for including alternatives in retirement accounts even though they are less liquid,\" Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst for TD Cowen, wrote in a policy note on July 16. Private assets may be slow to 'gain traction' Private equity firms, including Apollo Global Management, BlackRock, Blackstone, and KKR have introduced new products to make inroads into defined contribution plans. Several 401(k) plan administrators are already making private assets available to their participants. Retirement service provider Empower, which has 19 million plan participants, recently announced plans to introduce private investments in its offerings. \"This will be a pivotal moment in the evolution of retirement planning,\" Empower president and CEO Edmund F. Murphy III said in a statement to CNBC. \"Opening the door to responsibly managed alternative investments such as private equity, private credit and private real estate and digital assets like cryptocurrency, we can offer everyday savers access to a broader array of investment types.\" watch now VIDEO 3:43 03:43 Rodriques: Index funds for private markets are coming later this year Worldwide Exchange Retirement plan administrators are likely to move slowly to add private asset investment options due to the complexity of evaluating private assets. \"It will take 36 to 60 months to really gain traction,\" said Russ Ivinjack, the global chief investment officer at Aon. \"Fiduciaries are incredibly deliberate.\" Experts say the early private investment offerings could appear in target-date funds. Those funds contain a mix of investments that shift over time as a specified retirement date approaches. Proponents say that target-date funds offer managers the flexibility to adjust asset allocations and incorporate lower-cost index funds into the mix to offset the higher costs of private assets.

Financial advisors say that for many workers, the risks may outweigh the rewards.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to increase the availability of alternative assets in 401(k) plans. The order instructs the Department of Labor to reexamine its guidance to employers and plan administrators on incorporating such assets into retirement plans.\n\nAlternative investments are a broad category that includes real estate, cryptocurrencies and private-market assets, among others. That last subset, also called private assets, can include equity and credit in private (not publicly traded) firms. Pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds and high-net-worth individuals are traditional investors in these private markets.\n\nAlthough an executive order to independent agencies does not change policy, it is a strong signal of Trump's priorities and support of alternative investments in retirement plans. During Trump's first term, the Labor Department issued an information letter to plan fiduciaries, telling them that private equity may be part of a \"prudent investment mix\" in a professionally managed asset allocation fund in a 401(k) plan.\n\nFiduciaries have a legal and ethical obligation to work in the best interest of investors by considering the risk of loss and potential gains associated with investments. Thursday's order instructs the Labor Department to clarify its position on the appropriate fiduciary process associated with such funds.\n\nSome financial advisors are concerned that 401(k) investors lack the knowledge or experience to incorporate these more sophisticated, and often more costly, investments into their portfolios.\n\n\"When you have an unsophisticated investor that doesn't even understand the difference between a stock and a bond, and now all of a sudden you introduce the allure of getting rich in the private equity markets. You're only asking for trouble,\" said Charles Massimo, a Long Island, New York-based financial advisor and senior vice president at Wealth Enhancement.\n\nRetirement plans represent a significant market. Defined-contribution workplace plans \u2014 which include 401(k)s and 403(b) plans, among others \u2014 held $12.2 trillion as of the end of the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade association. About $8.7 trillion is in 401(k)s alone.\n\nAdvocates' argument for incorporating such investments in workplace retirement plans is that they could provide retail investors with more diversification away from public markets, and a chance for higher returns.\n\n\"Retirement savers are the ultimate long-term investors and would benefit from the diversification offered by the inclusion of private assets,\" Melissa Barosy, a spokesperson for the Investment Company Institute, said in an email.\n\nBut such investments are complex. Investors may be restricted in their ability to cash out, experts say, and fees tend to be high. The average exchange-traded fund carries a 0.51% annual management fee, about half the 1.01% fee of the average mutual fund, according to Morningstar data. Private equity firms typically collect a 2% management fee, plus 20% of the profit.\n\n\"If you're going to introduce these types of investments, you really have to have a concerted effort to be educating both plan sponsors and retirement investors about what these things are,\" said Lisa Gomez, who served under the Biden administration as Assistant Secretary for Employee Benefits Security, the Department of Labor division that oversees private-sector workplace retirement plans.\n\nUnlike publicly-traded assets, basic information on private equity investments \u2014 like what firms are in a fund and what their revenues and losses are \u2014 can be challenging to obtain.\n\n\"The rules aren't as standard with private investments,\" said Chris Noble, policy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog organization. That makes it hard to compare the values of private versus public assets. \"I'd argue, because of that, [401(k) investors] are just fine with stock and bonds,\" said Noble.\n\nSome experts also question the quality of those private assets that could be offered to retirement investors. Say you're a major player in private assets, said financial advisor Massimo. In that scenario, he said, \"I'm saving the best deals for my highest clients. It's the deals I really can't sell that I'm going to funnel off down to the participants that may not understand it or see it.\"\n\nThe law governing 401(k) plans requires plan sponsors to act as fiduciaries. However, the Department of Labor could issue guidance stating that alternative investments meet this obligation, which would help shield employers from lawsuits, experts say.\n\n\"It also could reassure plan advisers that they will not face litigation for including alternatives in retirement accounts even though they are less liquid,\" Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst at TD Cowen, said in a research note.",

As AI adoption leads to transformation across industries, we want to ensure that federal workers can fully harness these capabilities to better serve the American people. By removing cost barriers, we're enabling the government to access the same advanced AI that's already proving its value in the private sector. Government partners are already using Claude to improve and accelerate their work, ranging from groundbreaking scientific breakthroughs to mission critical national security operations, and we can\u2019t wait for more partners to use Claude's capabilities to advance their missions. How government partners can access Claude for $1 Our partnership with the General Services Administration has been instrumental in making Claude accessible to federal agencies. Building on last week's addition of Claude to the GSA schedule, which streamlined procurement, we're now able to further expand access through this offer. We're offering both Claude for Government , which supports FedRAMP High workloads that enable federal workers to use Claude for sensitive unclassified work, and Claude for Enterprise . Agencies will have access to our frontier models with continuous updates as new capabilities are released. To ensure successful adoption, we are also providing technical support to help agencies rapidly implement AI into their productivity and mission workflows. This package will be available for one year. Building on proven success with Claude Claude is already the trusted AI partner for some of the government's most critical missions. The Department of Defense selected Claude through an agreement with a $200 million ceiling with the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office to advance U.S. national security capabilities. At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , 10,000 scientists and researchers use Claude daily to accelerate scientific discoveries, and the District of Columbia Department of Health deployed Claude to help residents access health services in multiple languages. We are able to make this deployment because Claude meets the government's highest security standards. Our models offered through Claude for Government are certified for FedRAMP High, the most stringent requirement for handling unclassified sensitive government data. Through partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, agencies can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure while maintaining complete control over their data. Looking forward This expanded access reflects our commitment to accelerating AI adoption across the federal government. We believe the U.S. public sector should have access to the most advanced AI capabilities to tackle complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services. By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we're helping ensure AI serves the public interest. We are coordinating with GSA and other government partners to implement this initiative smoothly and quickly. We look forward to working closely with agencies to help them harness AI's transformative potential in support of their critical missions. We hope other companies will join us in taking similar steps to ensure the U.S. government has what it needs to operate as efficiently and effectively as possible.

Government partners are already using Claude to improve and accelerate their work, ranging from groundbreaking scientific breakthroughs to mission critical national security operations, and we can't wait for more partners to use Claude's capabilities to advance their missions.\n\nOur partnership with the General Services Administration has been instrumental in making Claude accessible to federal agencies. Building on last week's addition of Claude to the GSA schedule, which streamlined procurement, we're now able to further expand access through this offer. We're offering both Claude for Government, which supports FedRAMP High workloads that enable federal workers to use Claude for sensitive unclassified work, and Claude for Enterprise. Agencies will have access to our frontier models with continuous updates as new capabilities are released. To ensure successful adoption, we are also providing technical support to help agencies rapidly implement AI into their productivity and mission workflows. This package will be available for one year.\n\nClaude is already the trusted AI partner for some of the government's most critical missions. The Department of Defense selected Claude through an agreement with a $200 million ceiling with the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office to advance U.S. national security capabilities. At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 10,000 scientists and researchers use Claude daily to accelerate scientific discoveries, and the District of Columbia Department of Health deployed Claude to help residents access health services in multiple languages. We are able to make this deployment because Claude meets the government's highest security standards. Our models offered through Claude for Government are certified for FedRAMP High, the most stringent requirement for handling unclassified sensitive government data. Through partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, agencies can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure while maintaining complete control over their data.\n\nThis expanded access reflects our commitment to accelerating AI adoption across the federal government. We believe the U.S. public sector should have access to the most advanced AI capabilities to tackle complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services. By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we're helping ensure AI serves the public interest. We are coordinating with GSA and other government partners to implement this initiative smoothly and quickly. We look forward to working closely with agencies to help them harness AI's transformative potential in support of their critical missions. We hope other companies will join us in taking similar steps to ensure the U.S. government has what it needs to operate as efficiently and effectively as possible.\n\nTo gain access, department or agency leadership at eligible organizations should contact us at pubsec@anthropic.com.",

What should I do with this money? 'I don't know anything about investing': I'm inheriting a $150,000 IRA. What should I do with this money? Provided by Dow Jones Aug 11, 2025, 10:32:00 AM By Quentin Fottrell 'I will have 10 years to complete the withdrawals' \"I will have 10 years to complete the withdrawals.\" (Photo subject is a model.) Dear Quentin, I will soon inherit an IRA account. I'm in my 50s. My share will be about $150,000. I will have 10 years to complete the withdrawals. I don't know anything about investing and I'm not interested in doing my own investing. What recommendations do you have to set it and forget it? Expecting a Windfall Don't miss: 'The sky has not fallen - yet': Is it time to start worrying about a U.S. recession? Not keeping an eye on your portfolio is not a good idea. Dear Expecting, Given that you are sharing this IRA, I assume you are not the spouse of the deceased. That being the case, if the late owner has not yet taken their RMDs, Charles Schwab (SCHW) says you have three penalty-free options: 1) transfer the assets into an inherited IRA in your name (RMDs must begin no later than 12/31 of the year after death); 2) open an inherited IRA with the 10-year method (the money is available until 12/31 of the 10th year after the year the account holder died, after which all RMDs must take place); or 3) take a lump sum (with a high tax bracket). If the late owner had already started taking RMDs, new rules, which went into effect in 2025, state that you, as the non-spouse who inherited the IRA, must take an RMD each year, beginning the year after the original account owner's death. This applies to accounts that have been inherited since 2020. These RMDs are subject to the 10-year distribution rule, meaning the account should be emptied by the 10th year after the owner's death. What happens next depends on whether the original owner had already started taking RMDs. If you invest $100,000 in the S&P 500 SPX, with a 7% average return, expect to earn $387,000 over 20 years. The 60/40 rule recommends 60% stocks - say, an S&P 500 ETF, representing 500 of the largest U.S. companies, dividend stocks with 15% international equity exposure - and 30% in bonds and 10% in cash/cash alternatives for liquidity, in case of unexpected events, like CDs or high-yield savings accounts. It splits your money into higher/lower risk vehicles. There is one key difference between CDs and high-yield savings accounts: The latter are more liquid, meaning you can take your money out more easily. Typically, withdrawals are limited to half a dozen per month. With CDs, you are committing to a set interest rate. But interest rates can change with high-yield savings accounts - even after you deposit your money -  based on the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate. Clouds on the horizon With President Donald Trump's trade war and the as-yet unforeseen impact of his tariffs on the imports and price of goods, and the Federal Reserve's changeable - and currently cautious - approach to interest-rate policy, there is always the risk of an economic downturn or even a recession. A softening in the labor market is a worry. The economy added just 73,000 new jobs in July, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, up from 4.1% in June. It's, perhaps, not all clouds on the horizon: Gross domestic product rose by 3% on the year in the second quarter after slipping by 0.5% in the first quarter. That figure came at a price, however, and was due in part to a smaller trade deficit as higher tariffs stymied demand for imports. One way to \"set it and forget it\" involves having a risk profile commensurate with your age and having confidence that a diversified portfolio will see you safely over the long term. One way to 'set it and forget it' involves having a risk profile commensurate with your age. Given the gap between first- and second-quarter GDP, all eyes will be on third-quarter GDP. A recession is often defined as a fall in GDP in two consecutive quarters. Trump, meanwhile, has made clear that he believes interest rates are still high and has put pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates. Sales at retailers also rebounded last month, and Powell is cautious not to reignite the era of high inflation seen earlier this decade. A semi-conservative approach for someone approaching midlife: You could also put a third in a Fidelity Intermediate Bond Fund FTHRX, which invests in U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade bonds and maintains a dollar-weighted average; a Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond Index Fund VICBX, which invests 50% of assets in corporate bonds and 50% in U.S. government bonds; and/or a iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF AGG. Protecting your financial future Put money aside for an emergency that should last from six months to a year. If you are happy with your current mortgage rate and monthly repayments, assuming you would have mentioned it if this was a concern for you, investing this money in a \"set it and forget it\" policy (at least until you are near retirement age) is a wise move. But such a strategy should also allow for you to revisit your allocations every year or so; not keeping an eye on your portfolio is not a good idea. You may also wish to consider long-term-care insurance. For a $165,000-benefit policy with no inflation protection, it would cost roughly $950 for a single male (aged 55) and $1,500 for a single female (aged 55), according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance. Those premiums will rise as you get older. Still, you could put that on the back burner until you are turning 60. An estimated 70% of Americans will require long-term care. Long-term-care insurance can go up as you age, but you can customize the kind of policy you sign up for. Such decisions should be taken under the guidance of a trusted adviser. Long-term-care insurance can go up as you age, but you can customize the kind of policy you sign up for. \"Repeated government efforts to create a functioning market for long-term care insurance - or to provide public alternatives - have never taken hold,\" according to this guidance from KFF Health News, which is part of the nonprofit organization KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"Today, most insurers have stopped selling stand-alone long-term care policies,\" it adds. \"The ones that still exist are too expensive for most people. And they have become less affordable each year, with insurers raising premiums higher and higher. Many policyholders face painful choices to pay more, pare benefits, or drop coverage altogether. In other cases, people entitled to benefits confront lengthy response times to coverage requests or outright denials.\" See this $150,000 as an opportunity rather than a curse.

But that language still lives within us. You can hear it in the impromptu laughter that bubbles up during a walk with friends. You can feel it the moment you jump into a lake without thinking, dance in your kitchen, or get caught up in a game that makes time disappear. The instinct to play is still there; we\u2019ve just tucked it away under years of calendars, to-do lists, and the distractions of our fast-moving lives.

But by the time we reach adulthood, play is often dismissed as frivolous\u2014something reserved for vacations, nights out drinking, or children\u2019s birthday parties.

Play doesn\u2019t have to mean sports or board games (unless that\u2019s your thing). For adults, play can look like: Singing at full volume during your commute Tossing a frisbee with a friend Drawing, painting, or gardening Doing cartwheels in the grass with kids Learning a silly TikTok dance, even if no one\u2019s watching The key isn\u2019t what you do, it's how you feel doing it. If it sparks joy, feels a little aimless (in the best way), and pulls you into the moment, it probably counts as play. Share on X Relearning the Language So how do we bring more play into our grown-up lives? Start small. Give yourself permission to do one \u201cpointless\u201d thing this week just for the fun of it. Say yes to the invitation to be silly, even if it feels awkward at first. Schedule a walk with no route. Paint with your fingers. Let go of the idea that fun has to be productive. Play isn\u2019t about being good at something. It\u2019s about being free. And in a culture that often rewards seriousness, learning to speak the language of play again can feel radical. But maybe what we need most isn\u2019t another task or productivity hack\u2014maybe we just need to laugh more. Move more. Be a little lighter, together.
