# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for organizing the Neo4j Data Loader project into a clean, maintainable structure with proper separation of concerns. The current project has files scattered in the root directory, making it difficult to navigate and maintain.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files organized in a dedicated folder, so that I can easily find and run tests without cluttering the main project directory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look at the project structure THEN all Python test files SHALL be located in a `tests/` folder
2. WHEN I run tests THEN the test discovery SHALL work correctly from the new location
3. WHEN test files import project modules THEN the imports SHALL work correctly with updated paths
4. WHEN I add new tests THEN they SHALL follow the organized structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all configuration files organized in a dedicated folder, so that I can easily manage different environments and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look at the project structure THEN all configuration files SHALL be located in a `config/` folder
2. WHEN the application loads configurations THEN it SHALL find them in the new location
3. WHEN I need to modify configurations THEN they SHALL be easily accessible in one place
4. WHEN I deploy to different environments THEN configuration management SHALL be simplified

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all output files organized in a dedicated folder, so that generated files don't clutter the project directory and can be easily managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application generates output files THEN they SHALL be stored in an `output/` folder
2. WHEN I need to find generated metrics, logs, or data files THEN they SHALL be in the output directory
3. WHEN I clean up generated files THEN I can easily identify and remove them from the output folder
4. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL create the output directory if it doesn't exist

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all file paths updated in programs and documentation, so that the application continues to work correctly after reorganization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run any Python script THEN it SHALL find all dependencies and configurations in their new locations
2. WHEN I follow README instructions THEN all file paths SHALL be correct and up-to-date
3. WHEN I import modules THEN the import statements SHALL work with the new structure
4. WHEN I execute scripts THEN they SHALL generate outputs in the correct directories

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project structure to follow Python best practices, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the project structure THEN it SHALL follow standard Python project layout conventions
2. WHEN new developers join the project THEN they SHALL easily understand the organization
3. WHEN I package the project THEN the structure SHALL support proper packaging and distribution
4. WHEN I use development tools THEN they SHALL work seamlessly with the organized structure
