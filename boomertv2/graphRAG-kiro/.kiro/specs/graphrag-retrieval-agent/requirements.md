# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a minimal GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) retrieval-only system that combines vector similarity search with graph traversal to provide contextually rich information retrieval. The system uses Neo4j for graph storage, sentence transformers for embeddings, and exposes functionality through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server interface for integration with Claude Desktop.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to query a knowledge graph using natural language, so that I can retrieve relevant chunks of information along with their connected context (authors, articles, relationships).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a natural language query is provided THEN the system SHALL convert the query to an embedding using sentence-transformers
2. WHEN the query embedding is generated THEN the system SHALL perform vector similarity search against stored chunk embeddings in Neo4j
3. WHEN relevant chunks are found THEN the system SHALL expand the graph to retrieve connected entities (authors, articles)
4. WHEN graph expansion is complete THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON containing chunks with their contextual relationships
5. IF no relevant chunks are found THEN the system SHALL return an empty result set with appropriate status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Claude Desktop user, I want to access GraphRAG functionality through MCP tools, so that I can seamlessly integrate graph retrieval into my conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is running THEN it SHALL expose a single tool named "graph_retrieve"
2. WHEN "graph_retrieve" is called with a query parameter THEN it SHALL invoke the core retrieval functionality
3. WHEN retrieval is complete THEN the MCP server SHALL return properly formatted JSON response
4. IF an error occurs during retrieval THEN the MCP server SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL be compliant with Claude Desktop MCP specifications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to connect to Neo4j with configurable credentials, so that I can deploy it in different environments securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL connect to Neo4j using configurable connection parameters
2. WHEN Neo4j connection is established THEN it SHALL authenticate using username/password credentials
3. WHEN vector search is performed THEN it SHALL use the "chunk_embeddings" vector index
4. IF Neo4j connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN they SHALL use the "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" sentence transformer model

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application to run in a Docker container, so that I can deploy it consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is containerized THEN it SHALL run in a Docker container with Python 3.10+
2. WHEN the container starts THEN it SHALL install all required dependencies from requirements.txt
3. WHEN the container is deployed THEN it SHALL be able to connect to external Neo4j instances
4. WHEN environment variables are provided THEN the container SHALL use them for configuration
5. IF the container needs to be scaled THEN it SHALL support multiple instances running simultaneously

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular codebase where each functionality is a separate testable module, so that I can easily maintain and test the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN each functionality SHALL be implemented as a separate module
2. WHEN modules are created THEN each module SHALL be independently testable
3. WHEN tests are written THEN test cases and test data SHALL be defined in YAML format
4. WHEN testing is performed THEN a single Python test runner SHALL execute all test scenarios from YAML
5. IF new functionality is needed THEN it SHALL be implemented as a new module with corresponding tests

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want retrieved information to include both content and context, so that I can understand the source and relationships of the information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chunks are retrieved THEN each result SHALL include the chunk text content
2. WHEN graph expansion occurs THEN results SHALL include connected author information
3. WHEN articles are found THEN results SHALL include article titles and relationships
4. WHEN similarity scores are calculated THEN they SHALL be included in the response
5. IF multiple chunks from the same author/article exist THEN they SHALL be properly grouped in the response

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want minimal code and documentation with only essential features, so that the codebase remains lean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL include only essential functionality without excess features
2. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL be minimal and focus only on critical information
3. WHEN new features are considered THEN they SHALL be approved before implementation
4. WHEN modules are designed THEN they SHALL follow the principle of doing one thing well
5. IF additional features are suggested THEN they SHALL be categorized as "must-have" or "good-to-have"
