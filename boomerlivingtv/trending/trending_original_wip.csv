Denmark will soon be tied with Libya to have the highest official retirement age—meaning the age when a person can access their full government pension or social security check—in the world.

Libya’s current official retirement age is 70.

 And, following a law passed this spring, Denmark will soon follow suit, raising the age for those born after Dec. 31, 1970, to claim full pension benefits to 70 years, up from 67. The change will be implemented gradually through 2040.

Key Takeaways
Denmark will soon be tied with Libya as having the highest official retirement age, at 70 years old.
Other countries with high retirement ages include Australia, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United States.
Countries with low official retirement ages often have high effective retirement ages, meaning people tend to work until their mid-60s regardless of where they live.
While the United States will avoid a raise in the retirement age this year, from 67 years old, the Republican Party has continually proposed this during budget talks.
Even before the law was passed, Denmark was tied with the likes of Australia, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Italy, and the Netherlands for the second-highest retirement age. The United States followed in third place, with an official retirement age of 66.7 years old, and Spain in fourth place with 66.5 years.
2

When to Stop Working
There are a few reasons why retirement ages are increasing worldwide. First, longer life expectancies are straining pension systems.
4

This was the key driver behind Denmark’s raising of the retirement age, with the country tying its official retirement age to life expectancy since 2006.
5
 That is subject to change, though, after this final hike.

“We no longer believe that the retirement age should be increased automatically,” Social Democrat Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said. “[Our party] can’t just keep saying that people have to work a year longer.”
3

Second, aging populations due to declining fertility rates have meant that fewer young workers are supporting more and more retirees, risking the longevity of pension systems.
4

And finally, fiscal pressure from unbalanced budgets and inflation has forced governments to rein in spending on public pension systems by raising the age of retirement to contain costs.
6
7

Legal vs. Effective Retirement Age
Nominally, these retirement ages are high compared to countries like India, Indonesia, and Turkey, which all have retirement ages set in the 50s. Saudi Arabia has the lowest retirement age in the world, with some workers being able to access their full pension benefits by 47.
8

Few people in these countries, though, actually stop working so young. In reality, these countries’ effective retirement ages, or the average age when people tend to stop working, all lie in the mid- to late 60s.
9

“There is no mandatory retirement age,” says Doug Carey, CFA, the founder and president of WealthTrace, a software provider for retirement planners. “Many people continue working well into their 70s [despite official retirement ages].”

The Case for the United States
The effective retirement age in the United States is actually much younger than the legal retirement age. If you want to access your Social Security benefits in the U.S., you’ll have to wait until you’re 67 if you were born after 1960. Those born in the years 1943 to 1954 were able to access their benefits by 66.
10
 However, according to MassMutual, most people in the U.S. tend to retire by 62.
11

Despite Americans’ obvious preference for earlier retirement, there have been ongoing efforts to raise the retirement age by the Republican Party. For example, last year, the Republican Study Committee—a group that includes roughly 80% of all Republican lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives, as well as the entirety of House Republican leadership—suggested that the Social Security Administration should raise the full retirement age to 69 by 2033.
12
13

This proposal did not make its way into the 2026 budget reconciliation bill, frequently dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” though reforms are not off the table in the near future.
14
 The Social Security Board of Trustees recently reported that the program expects to run out of money a year sooner than previously reported, in 2034.
15

The Bottom Line
At the end of the day, retirement ages are likely to keep going up, not down.

“Retirement ages are increasing worldwide,” says Carey. “Most people need to start planning for a longer work life.”

To do so, Carey recommends people maximize their retirement contributions, delay their Social Security or pension benefits for as long as possible, and budget for a longer life.

“Don’t assume you will pass away at your life expectancy. Most people should assume they will live to at least 90. Have a financial plan built for you and add in healthcare inflation and potential long-term care costs,” he says.",https://www.investopedia.com/country-with-highest-retirement-age-11741440

There are a number of factors to take into consideration when choosing where you want to retire, including the lifestyle you want and your financial situation.

In addition to looking for options that meet most of your needs, you’ll want to consider any major downsides or trade-offs you’d have to make, such as a lack of accessible health care or a high cost of living.

Financial services website Bankrate recently ranked all 50 states based on 15 metrics, including affordability, health care and weather, to determine the best and worst places to retire in the U.S. The study used data from a variety of sources, including the Council for Community and Economic Research, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The metrics were weighed according to survey responses gathered by Bankrate in May 2025 on what Americans say are their top priorities for choosing a retirement destination. As a result, affordability, weather and neighborhood safety influenced overall scores the most.

Here are the 10 worst states to retire, according to Bankrate, where you may have to compromise when it comes to cost, safety and access to health care:

Louisiana
Texas
Oklahoma
Arkansas
Nebraska
Alabama
Kansas
California
New Mexico
Florida
Weather also played a significant role in landing several of these states at the bottom of the overall rankings. Louisiana ranked No. 39 for weather and Texas came in at No. 47 in that category.

“Natural disasters really degraded the scores of almost every state across the Gulf. Texas, Florida — even states that you really think about as primary retirement destinations,” Stephen Kates, a certified financial planner and Bankrate financial analyst, tells CNBC Make It. “They didn’t do as well in the weather category because of their propensity to have hurricanes and other natural disasters.”

Personal preference matters
It can be helpful to consider these rankings and the metrics used to determine them, but ultimately, the best place for you to retire will depend on your personal preferences.

Retiring in Louisiana or Oklahoma may look challenging based on these metrics, for example, but if that’s where your family lives and you want to be close to them, it may be worth planning ahead and figuring out how to live well there, despite potential drawbacks.

If living in a tax-friendly state is important to you, Wyoming may be your best fit, Kates says. The state came in at No. 3 overall and No. 1 for tax-friendliness. But you’d be giving up other potential amenities.

“You pay very little state taxes, but you have little access to some of the other things that you may want,” he says. “Wyoming is not great for arts and entertainment — it’s a big, more rural place.”

Conditions can also vary greatly within a given state when it comes to metrics like neighborhood safety. State-level data can be a good place to start, but you may need to dig deeper or visit in person to determine if an area is right for you, especially if you’re considering a big state like California or Texas, Kates says.

“Where you live in California or Texas or Florida, or any state, is going to matter because we’re aggregating a lot of data,” he says. “If you live in Los Angeles, it’s going to be very different than if you live in Sacramento or La Jolla; if you live in Dallas, very different [than] Houston.”

Planning for retirement is ‘a lot more than just putting a pin on the map’
You may choose not to relocate in retirement, or prefer to wait until later on to make a move. As people live longer than they used to and thus may be retired longer, it’s wise to think about your retirement in phases, Kates says.

“It’s a lot more than just putting a pin on the map and saying, ‘This is the place,’” he says. “If you’re going to live in retirement for 25 or 30 years, there’s going to be phases of that. And how you figure that out is extremely relevant.”

If you want to dedicate time to traveling in your early retirement years, it may not make sense to also try to move your home base during that period. But a decade or so later, you may be more interested in settling down somewhere new.

Kates calls these the “go, low-go and no-go” phases of retirement, alluding to idea that as you get older, you’ll likely want or need to slow down.

Closeup of a last will and testament.
Because there are no state-specific taxes in Georgia, it is a favorable state for you and your heirs to protect your estate. This policy is not indicative of Georgia inheritance laws overall, though, as they heavily depend on the property in the estate. The state is also known for having one of the weakest sets on spousal inheritance laws in the nation.

A financial advisor can aid you in planning your estate or managing your inheritance. Speak with an advisor today.


Does Georgia Have an Inheritance Tax or Estate Tax?
No, Georgia does not have an estate tax or an inheritance tax on its inheritance laws. Any deaths after July 1, 2014 fall under these rules.

Even with this welcome benefit, there are some returns that must be filed on behalf of the decedent and their estate, such as:

Final individual federal and state income tax returns: These are each due by tax day of the year following the individual’s death.
Federal estate/trust income tax return: This is due by April 15 of the year following the individual’s death.
Federal estate tax return: This is due nine months after the individual’s death, though an automatic six-month extension is available if asked for prior to the conclusion of the nine-month period. As of 2025, this is required only of individual estates that exceed a gross asset and prior taxable gift value of $13.99 million. (Note that the Trump tax plan increased the exemption to $15 million for 2026, and indexes to inflation for each year after that.)
Because estates are not their own withstanding entities in the eyes of the IRS, the government tax agency requires an employer identification number (EIN). You can do this online, by fax or via mail.

Dying With a Will in Georgia
Georgia considers residents who die with a valid will prepared “testate.” By state law, that means a will must have been signed not only by the decedent, but also by two witnesses. These witnesses cannot be just anyone, as they are required to be at least somewhat acquainted with the property within the will. Unless any of these stipulations are not met, the court will typically follow the decedent’s exact wishes. In the event that there’s no heir named for certain property in the estate, it will fall under intestate succession laws.

Valid wills name an executor to manage the disbursement of the estate’s property to heirs. A judge will need to approve the executor, but once this is done, they become responsible for handling everything related to the estate, including its debts and liabilities. Executors also handle the will’s submission to probate court.

There are two styles of probate that Georgia law employs when dealing with the estates of decedents: solemn form probate and common form probate. They are extremely similar to one another, but the main difference centers on is who gets notified of the probate proceedings.

For solemn form probate, every possible heir who could have received estate property if there were no will must be notified and given an official copy of the will. On the other hand, common form probate eliminates this heir communication requirement, though heirs are allowed to ask for a copy of the will.

It can be tough to get in touch with all heirs, so common form probate should be used whenever there are no issues with the will. But if any party is believed to be looking to contest it, solemn form probate is a better fit. When this occurs, the court will determine a final date by which anyone who wants to contest the will must take action. Although much less frequent, common form probate does also allow parties to contest the will, as long as it’s done within four years of the proceedings.

According to Georgia inheritance laws, you can file a probate petition asking the court to allow the decedent’s surviving spouse and children to take a year’s worth of finances out of the estate. The heirs and anyone owed money from the estate must agree on this to be processed officially.

Dying Without a Will in Georgia
The state of Georgia highlighted on a map.
The term “intestate” refers to when an individual passes away without a valid will. However, just because the decedent hasn’t specified where his or her property should end up, doesn’t mean it will go uninherited. So to manage the inheritance of intestate decedents, Georgia has created its intestate succession laws. These are meant to look for any possible relative, near and far, who could inherit your estate.

Although the court will dictate how your intestate estate is distributed, it doesn’t actually do the management for you. Therefore, an executor must be appointed. Since there is no will, the Georgia courts will choose one who is mentally competent and close to or part of the family (members can petition the court to be the administrator of an estate with no will).

It’s worth noting, though, that you can avoid this entire intestate succession process simply by taking the time to create a thorough will for your estate in accordance with Georgia inheritance laws. If this venture comes off as overwhelmingly difficult, there are financial advisors who can help out.

Spouses in Georgia Inheritance Law
Georgia is probably the state with the weakest spousal inheritance laws. The majority of U.S. states will afford the surviving spouse all of the decedent’s estate whether they have their own kids together or not.

For childless marriages, the above rule holds true, but if children are included things change drastically. In this case, the decedent’s estate is split evenly between the surviving spouse and all of their children. It’s important to note, though, that a surviving spouse is entitled to a minimum of one-third of the estate, regardless of how that affects the aforementioned even split.

Disinheriting a Spouse in Georgia Inheritance Law
If a decedent disinherits a spouse, this means that the decedent has essentially deleted him or her from the will, according to Georgia inheritance laws. While many states won’t allow this to happen completely, Georgia is much more open to the possibility. In fact, disinherited spouses are only permitted to receive a monetary allowance for the year that follows the individual’s death. After that, the estate is not obligated to assist the surviving spouse financially whatsoever.

Children in Georgia Inheritance Law
There’s only one situation in Georgia inheritance law when children will receive the complete estate of their parents: when there is an absence of a surviving spouse. In scenarios where there is a surviving spouse, the children are given up to two-thirds of the decedent’s estate, even if the surviving spouse is also their parent, according to Georgia inheritance laws.

Intestate Succession: Spouses and Children
Inheritance Situation	Who Inherits Your Property
– If spouse and no children	– Entire estate to spouse
– If spouse and children	– Estate split evenly between spouse and children
– Spouse is entitled to at least 33% of estate, otherwise even split
– If children and no spouse	– Entire estate to children in even parts
For all intents and purposes, adopted children are the same as biological children under George inheritance law. Because they have been legally claimed by their adoptive parents, full inheritance rights ensue. But if you gave away your own children for adoption, they will not be considered part of the heirs of your estate.

Generally speaking, children you conceived prior to your death but who were born after it are granted normal biological inheritance rights. Georgia does stipulate that the child must live for at least 120 hours after birth and be born within 10 months of your death, though.

Should you have a child (outside of your legal marriage), a few boxes must be checked before an illegitimate child can claim inheritance, according to Georgia inheritance laws. Firstly, a court must decide on paternity. You then will have had to recognize your paternity in writing and have signed the birth certificate. There also must be clear physical evidence of your paternity.

Just because a child maintains a relationship with you as a stepchild or foster child does not mean he or she will receive automatic intestate rights to your estate. But if you’d like this person to be included in your will, just write him or her in.

Unmarried Individuals Without Children in Georgia Inheritance Law
People who pass away without surviving children, a surviving spouse or a will have the most complicated intestate succession situation you’ll come across in Georgia. While eventually the state could claim your property as its own, it’ll exhaust every possible heir option it can to attempt to ensure that doesn’t happen. So if you fall into this category, this is how the state will distribute your assets to eligible heirs:

Intestate Succession: Extended Family
Inheritance Situation	Who Inherits Your Property
– If no spouse and children	– Estate split evenly between grandchildren of deceased children
– If no grandchildren	– Entire estate to parents
– If no parents	– Estate split evenly between siblings
– If no siblings	– Estate split evenly between nieces and nephews
– If no nieces and nephews	– Estate split evenly between grandnieces and grandnephews
– If no grandnieces and grandnephews	– Entire estate to paternal/maternal grandparents
– If no grandparents	– Estate split evenly between paternal/maternal aunts and uncles
– If no aunts and uncles	– Estate split evenly between paternal/maternal cousins
In a situation where the state cannot find any heirs, your estate’s property will likely escheat to Georgia, making it official state property. However, the state goes further than most in describing what your property will be used for. Georgia law states that “the estate is transferred to the board of education in the county where the estate’s probate proceeding was filed.”

This requires your estate’s executor to file a petition in probate court saying that he or she and the court have failed in finding an heir over the four years since the case began. As a final attempt, this petition opens a 60-day window for any previously unknown heirs to step forward before the transfer to the state is made, according to Georgia inheritance laws.

Non-Probate Georgia Inheritances
Welcome sign in Georgia that says: ""We're glad Georgia's on your mind.""
When a decedent dies, certain types of property will not be eligible for inclusion in probate or any related processes, according to Georgia inheritance laws. Typically these are financial accounts, and include the following:

Property in a living trust
Life insurance payouts
401(k)s, IRAs and other retirement accounts
Transfer and payable-on-death accounts
Property owned in joint tenancy
These exceptions were not randomly chosen. Because they all require the naming of a beneficiary when receiving them, their inheritance has already been worked out. Those that would like these accounts to become a part of their estate upon their death can do so by making their estate the beneficiary.

Other Situations in Georgia Inheritance Law
Whereas some states will weaken the inheritance rights of half-blood relatives, Georgia treats them as if they were wholly related to you. Therefore, if intestate succession calls for it, your siblings and half-siblings will receive the same share of your property.

In Georgia inheritance laws, the inheritance rights that your own children born after your death have are extended to all posthumously born relatives under intestate succession.

If the intestate succession process dictates that your property be left to a relative that is living in the U.S. illegally, they won’t be withheld inheritance rights just because of their immigration status. The same policy applies to non-U.S. citizens as well.

Murderers who were named in the will of their victim will lose all chances of receiving their previously rightful inheritance, according to Georgia inheritance laws. The state government abides by this rule as well, meaning that intestate estates are afforded the same protection.

Additional Estate Planning Things to Consider in Georgia
Although Georgia does not collect estate or inheritance taxes, planning ahead is still important for managing how property is handled after death. Some assets, like life insurance and retirement accounts, can be passed directly to named beneficiaries and do not go through probate. Other types of property may need to be settled in court unless specific steps are taken.

Creating a will allows you to decide who receives your property and to name someone to care for minor children. Trusts can be used to manage assets during life and transfer them after death without going through probate. Naming beneficiaries on financial accounts and using joint ownership can also help streamline the process.

Common planning documents include:

Will. Lets you choose how your property is divided and who will administer your estate.
Power of attorney. Gives someone permission to handle your financial matters if you are unable.
Healthcare directive. Lets you state your medical care preferences and name someone to speak for you if necessary.
Revocable or irrevocable trust. Can be used to hold and manage property and may help avoid court proceedings.
Bottom Line
Georgia has no inheritance or estate tax, but who receives property depends on whether the person left a will. If there is a valid will, it is followed through probate. If not, state law decides how to divide the estate among family members. Spouses do not automatically receive everything and may share the estate with children. Adopted and posthumous children are treated like biological children. Some assets, like life insurance and retirement accounts, pass directly to named beneficiaries. If no heirs are found, the estate may go to the local board of education.
