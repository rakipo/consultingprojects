    STAGE 3: QUERY + GRAPH RAG USAGE (Claude reads Neo4j)
    │
    ├── Universal Content Intelligence Queries:
    │   ├── "Find top 3 high-urgency gaps across financial planning content"
    │   ├── "Generate content outline using insights with confidence > 0.8 from recent PDFs"
    │   ├── "Which primary topics have the most content gaps across all content types?"
    │   ├── "Show me misconception-type insights from legal articles with high actionability"
    │   ├── "Find hook patterns that work best for technical content vs. educational content"
    │
    ├── Advanced Use Cases:
