TREE 3: STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE LAYER - Business Insights Engine

What This Tree Does
Transforms your Neo4j knowledge graph (from Tree 1 or 2) into actionable business intelligence through advanced GraphRAG queries. Input: populated graph with articles, topics, entities. Output: strategic insights like "Your audience segments," "Content gaps," "Monetization opportunities," and "Trending themes you're missing." Think of it as your content strategist powered by graph data.

Why You Need This Tree
Having a knowledge graph is like owning a gold mine - valuable but useless until you extract the gold. This layer runs sophisticated queries that reveal hidden patterns: which topics consistently perform well, what audience segments you're underserving, which pain points you discuss but haven't monetized. Converts technical graph infrastructure into competitive business intelligence.

Tree Distinctions
- Tree 1 (Full Pipeline): Creates the data foundation - articles become intelligent graph relationships
- Tree 2 (MVP): Basic version of Tree 1 for rapid prototyping and concept validation  
- Tree 3 (This Intelligence): Business strategy layer that analyzes the graph Tree 1/2 creates - requires either as foundation

Purpose: Extract strategic value from graph data through advanced queries that reveal audience insights, content opportunities, and market gaps invisible in flat data.

Example Strategic Insights This Layer Provides:

Audience Discovery:
- "You have 3 distinct audience segments: Family Caregivers (47% of content), Legal Professionals (31%), and Senior Housing Operators (22%)"
- "Family Caregivers engage most with emotional/story-based content, Legal Professionals prefer data/compliance focus"

Content Gap Analysis:  
- "High search volume for 'Medicaid planning for dementia' but only 3 articles in your graph - major opportunity"
- "You discuss caregiver stress frequently but have no content about caregiver self-care solutions"

Monetization Mapping:
- "18 articles discuss family caregiver overwhelm but no services address this pain point - potential coaching/support product"
- "Elder law automation content gets high engagement from attorneys but no corresponding service offerings"

Strategic Recommendations:
- "Create 5-part content series on dementia Medicaid planning targeting Family Caregiver persona"  
- "Develop caregiver support service based on recurring stress/overwhelm themes in content"
- "Launch elder law automation consulting based on attorney engagement patterns"
