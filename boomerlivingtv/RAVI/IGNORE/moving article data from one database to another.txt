This is about **moving article data from one database to another**, but making it smarter.

**What we have now:**
- Articles stored in PostgreSQL (regular database)
- Each article has: title, content, author, tags, publish date

**What we want:**
- Same articles stored in Neo4j (graph database) 
- But organized as connected nodes instead of flat rows

**Why?**
Graph databases let you find connections like:
- "Which authors write about AI most?"
- "What topics are trending together?"
- "Which articles mention the same companies?"

**How it works:**
1. Pull articles from PostgreSQL
2. Send each article to Claude AI
3. Claude extracts people, companies, topics from the content
4. Store everything in Neo4j as connected dots

**Example:**
Article: "Dr. Smith discusses AI in healthcare"

Becomes connected nodes:
- Article ← written by → Dr. Smith (Author)
- Article ← tagged with → AI (Topic) 
- Article ← mentions → healthcare (Entity)

Now you can ask questions like "Find all articles by doctors about AI" and get smart answers.

It's basically **making your article database smarter** so you can find patterns and connections.
